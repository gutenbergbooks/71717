PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
The principal inducement of the author, in
preparing the following Journal for publication,
originated in an idea that a plain narrative of a
a cruise through an unfrequented part of the
ocean, comprising a particular description of a
groupe of Islands, never before explored, and
forming, perhaps, the latest inhabited portion of
the globe, might not be without interest.  It is
believed, that, in habits, opinions, and modes of
living, the people of the Mulgrave Islands,
approach more nearly to a state of nature than
those of any other known region.  The object
of the CRUISE, of which a concise account is
now offered to the Public, necessarily led to a
more full examination of these Islands than has
yet been made, or than it will ever probably be
thought worth while to make again, except for
a similar purpose.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The delay in publishing this little work originated
partly in the hesitation of the author in
offering, and partly in that of the booksellers, in
accepting it; and the public must decide whether
they were not both right in the first instance.
It only remains for him to state, that all he
aimed at or desired, was to give a plain,
unpretending narrative, of what he saw, which,
without presuming to merit applause, might at
least escape censure.

CRUISE OF THE U. S. SCHOONER DOLPHIN.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
In the year 1824, the crew of a whale ship,
called the Globe, belonging to the island of
Nantucket, mutinied while in the Pacific Ocean,
murdered the officers in latitude about eight degrees
south, longitude one hundred and sixty degrees
west, and carried the ship to the Mulgrave Islands,
where it was proposed by the chief mutineers to
burn her, and form a settlement.  Here they landed
a great part of the stores, sails, rigging, &amp;c.; but
some of the crew, who had no part in the mutiny,
taking advantage of the others' being on shore, cut
the cables, just at the dusk of evening, and, making
sail, stood out to sea with a fine breeze.
</p>

<p>
The mutineers pursued the ship, as soon as they
discovered she was underway, but, finding that she
outsailed them, they soon gave up the chase, and
returned to the shore.  The nautical instruments
of every description had been taken on shore by
order of the mutineers, so that the people on board
of the Globe were left to traverse a vast ocean,
studded with islands, and rocks, and reefs, where
currents are frequent, strong, and variable, without
any other guide by which to direct their course
than the stars and prevailing winds.  The Mulgrave
Islands are situated in north latitude six
degrees, east longitude one hundred and seventy.
three degrees; and although the passage of the
Globe was very long, she arrived safely at
Valparaiso, where the crew informed the American
Consul of the events that had transpired.  It was
unfortunately at a period when our commerce, on the
coast of the Pacific, required for its protection all
the naval force we had at the time on that
station, and no measures were taken to bring the
offenders to answer for their crimes, until some
months after the Globe had returned to the United
States.  Information of the occurrence having
been communicated to the secretary of the navy,
he, in 1825, directed Commodore Hull, then
commanding our squadron in the Pacific Ocean, to
despatch the United States schooner Dolphin, in
search of such of the mutineers as had been left at
the Mulgraves.  Besides the importance of bringing
the guilty to punishment, for the sake of
example,&mdash;humanity for the suffering condition of
the innocent, that had been left by those who
escaped, dictated that something should be done
for their relief.  Accordingly on the 18th of
August, 1825, the Dolphin sailed from Chorillos,
on the coast of Peru, under the command of
Lieutenant Percival, who was directed, preparatory
to his departure from the coast, to stop at
some convenient place for such refreshments as
might be necessary for the cruise.  On the day
following, we stood into the harbour of Casma, and
anchored, when we fired several guns, as signals,
to acquaint the people in the interior of the arrival
of a stranger that wanted their aid.  It was not
long before we had the satisfaction of seeing a
number of people, who had made their appearance
in obedience to the signal.  A few moments'
conversation with them, satisfied us that our wants
could not be supplied here.  Wood might have been
obtained, but the water was neither good, nor
convenient to be got at, and all other things that
we were in want of, could only be procured at the
most extravagant prices.
</p>

<p>
After laying at anchor a few hours, we got
underway, and stood along the coast for a small
place called Santa, which was situated a few
leagues to the north of us, Casma is but a poor
harbour, as it lies so much exposed to the prevailing
southerly winds, that frequently a high and
dangerous surf breaks upon that part of the shore
where alone (at any time) it is practicable to land.
A valley, covered with thickets of reeds and bushes,
extends back from the sea for several miles.  In
it there is neither habitations nor inhabitants, and
a sandy waste of hill and dale separates it from
the little Indian village of Casma, which is several
miles in the interior.  It is situated in a valley,
about a league in circumference, which is watered
by a small stream.  The soil is rich, but poorly
cultivated.  The inhabitants (of whom there is
about a thousand) are all Indians.  They live in
wretched habitations, and their intercourse with
the Spaniards for centuries, it seems, has not
much improved their condition in any respect.
Their principal dependance is upon the sale of
their poultry to such ships as visit their harbour
for the trade of the interior country, and to
people thus engaged, their proximity may sometimes
be a very great convenience.
</p>

<p>
The harbour of Santa is formed by several
small islands, lying a little to the south of it, and
about a mile from the main.  We passed between
the islands and the main, although it was night,
and very dark.  On the following morning, we
made the customary signal, by firing a gun, which,
in a very short time, brought the captain of the
port down to the beach.  He had not much the
appearance of official dignity, having a long black
beard, and was in no respect prepossessing.  Rude,
however, as was his exterior, he was profuse in
offers of hospitality.  He assured us that we should
be abundantly supplied with every thing we wanted,
and requested that an officer might be sent
with him to Santa, to negociate for our supplies.
The purser and myself were ordered upon this
service, and not having time to send to Santa for
horses, it being six miles from our anchorage, we
were reduced to the necessity of a most painful
ride, behind the captain of the port and a
companion whom he had brought with him.  The road
was over an uninterrupted plain, which was almost
everywhere covered with impenetrable thickets of
reeds, and the Algaroba[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>], and in some places a
foot or two deep with water that had escaped from
the streams of the cultivated valley.  When we
arrived at the door of the commandant's house, he
shewed us in with an air of some formality, and
welcomed us with every Spanish expression of
hospitality.  The appearance of the house
corresponded well with that of its occupant.  It was
disgusting in the extreme.  There were but two
rooms in it, one of which was occupied as a
granary and bed-room, and the other as a pulparia,[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>]
and the ordinary conveniences of the family.  In
the middle of the latter, hung a hog, weighing
three or four hundred pounds, which had been
butchered that morning.  The captain pretended
he could himself supply whatever we asked for,
assuring us that he would sell more cheaply than
any one else, and evinced an extreme jealousy at
our conversing with any other than himself upon
the subject of our visit to Santa.  As a matter of
courtesy, we soon made our way to the house of
the governor, and paid our respects to him.  He
seemed to feel highly complimented with our
attention, and, like the captain of the port, proffered
his assistance to obtain for us whatever we stood
in need of.  He bore the name of the cruel
conqueror of Peru, it being nothing less than the
great Pizarro; but it was evident, from his
complexion and curling locks, that his ancestors came
from Africa.  Notwithstanding this disadvantage,
however, he could not be compared to the captain
of the port without disparagement, and, considering
the wretched society in which he lived, I
thought he discharged his official duties rather
creditably.  Both the governor and captain of
the port invited us to dine with them; and each,
fearing we would make our purchase of the other,
solicited our company very earnestly.  We finally
accepted the invitation of the latter, and he escorted
us back to his house, where the table was already
smoking with savoury dishes, served up in a
variety of ways from the huge animal we had seen
there in the morning, under circumstances by no
means calculated to improve our appetites.  A
rabble, formed of half naked Indians, and long
bearded white men, assembled in the room, while
we were at dinner, some of whom sat down at
table unceremoniously, and partook with us.  Our
host indulged himself freely with the use of
aquadiente,[<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>] and, ere we finished our repast, his house
exhibited a constant scene of riot, from which we
were exceedingly glad to escape.  After making
a few purchases we returned on board.  The next
day, a party, consisting of about thirty or forty,
came down to make us a visit.  All degrees of
the society of Santa, without any distinction,&mdash;whites,
mulattoes, and Indians, having, it would
seem, mingled together for the occasion.  They
remained with us all day, eating and drinking,
and appeared to be very happy; but begged for
every thing that came in their way.  At sunset,
to our great satisfaction, they left us, and on
the following morning, we got underway, and
continued along the coast to the north.
</p>

<p>
The small town of Santa contains about two
thousand inhabitants, nearly all of whom are
Indians.  It is situated in latitude nine degrees
south, in the valley of Santa, which is twenty or
thirty miles in circumference, beautiful and rich
in soil, and watered by a deep and rapid stream,
which takes its rise in the Andes, at the distance of
a hundred miles from the sea coast.  Previous to
the revolution, it was a flourishing valley, with a
numerous population, producing rice, wheat, and
other grain, in considerable quantities, for
exportation; and frequently large herds of cattle
were driven from it to Lima.  It abounds also
in fruits, such as oranges, lemons, grapes, and a
variety of other delicious kinds.  Large farming
establishments are every where to be seen, each
comprehending thousands of acres, and previous
to the revolution possessed by gentlemen of ample
fortune.  All of these are, now in ruins, and most
of them unoccupied.  The climate of Santa is
mild, and almost unvarying.  Here, as in nearly
all the rest of Peru, bordering on the Pacific Ocean,
it never rains, and wherever the land is cultivated
it is watered from the rivers.
</p>

<p>
Around the cultivated valley of Santa, are spread
extensive plains of barren sand; and at a short
distance back from the sea rises the first range of
gloomy and sterile mountains which, increasing in
altitude as you advance into the interior, terminates
in the eternal snow-covered Andes, at the
distance of from fifty to a hundred miles.  At
Santa we obtained wood with ease, and from two
or three old wells, near the shore, filled our
casks with brackish water.  Where the river
empties into the harbour it is so much exposed to
the sea as to render watering difficult, and almost
always dangerous.  Santa was a place of some
trade before the revolution, it being connected by
direct communication with some mines of the
precious metals in the interior.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th of August, we anchored in the
roads of Huanchaco, and communicated with
several vessels that were lying there.  Huanchaco
is an Indian village, and the seaport of
the city of Bolivia, the ancient name of which
was Truxillo.  It is exposed to the sea, and at
times the surf breaks so violently on the shore,
as to prevent all intercourse with the vessels at
anchor.  The Indians are provided with a float
they call Balsa, and on which they pass through
this surf, in cases of great emergency, when no
boat could live in it.  It is composed merely of
two bundles of long reeds, bound compactly
together, tapering a little at one end, and the two
bundles secured to each other, the small ends
coming to a point, somewhat resembling in
appearance the bow of a boat.  In the middle it is
hollowed sufficiently for a man to seat himself
securely.  It is usually about fifteen feet long, and
from two to three feet wide.  It is calculated for
one man only, who directs it with his paddle.  I
one day witnessed their wonderful skill in the
management of the balsa.  The surf was breaking
so furiously, that the men, accustomed to work
in it, advised me not to go on board of my ship.
Whilst I was standing on the shore, with several
of them around me, a boat appeared just without
the heavy rollers that were setting in, filled with
people, who it was evident were strangers to the
danger they were about to encounter, as they were
dashing on fearlessly into the surf.  The Indians
near me made motions, and called to them not to
advance further, but they neither saw nor heard
the warning.  Observing this, six or eight of
them launched their balsas, and in a few minutes
were in the midst of the breakers.  They were
just in time, for the boat in a moment afterwards
darted forward with great velocity, and suddenly
disappeared.  The wave had broken, and was
foaming over her, and another must have terminated
the existence of every person on board;
but, before the next swell, that came rolling on in
quick succession had reached them, each man was
upon a balsa, and the skilful and intrepid Indians
bore them safely to the shore.  We remained but
a few hours at Huanchaco, when we continued on
to the north, and on the 25th of August, came up
with the Lobos Islands, in latitude six degrees
south, and distant about a hundred miles from the
coast.  They are barren rocks, rising in some
places several hundred feet, and no where have any
appearance of vegetation.  With the aid of our
glasses, we saw at a distance a number of people
upon these inhospitable rocks, and supposing they
might be some unfortunate seamen, whose vessel
had been cast away, we hove to, with a view of
affording them relief.  Upon examination,
however, they proved to be Indians from the coast,
who had come here on a catamaran, upon a
fishing enterprise, it being the season when great
quantities of fish, resembling mackerel, are taken
on the shores of these Islands.
</p>

<p>
Previous to ascertaining who these fishermen
were, we landed on a small island nearer to us,
where, on the side of a hill, forty or fifty yards
distant, we saw several hundreds of seals basking
in the sun.  The rock rose perhaps a hundred
feet, and many of the seals were near the top of
it.  The noise of our landing gave them the alarm,
and, as we had cut them off from the water, they
made the best of their way for the other side of
the hill, joining in a terrific growl like so many
furious mastiffs.  They had reached the top of
the hill, and were descending on the opposite side,
when we overtook them, and very wantonly killed
several.  They were so large that many of them
would have weighed at least five or six hundred
pounds, but their motions were extremely clumsy.
Whenever we came near them they would growl,
and snapped at us like a ferocious dog, and
their long teeth warned us not to approach them
within striking distance.  Considering their
immense size, it is astonishing bow slight a blow will
kill them when given on the nose.  If, however,
this fatal part is missed, and they receive a severe
blow upon any other part of the head, they suffer
but little injury, and become extremely tenacious
of life, particularly if it has time to swell.  The
nose is then no longer a mortal part, and it is almost
impossible to subdue them.  We witnessed several
instances of this kind, being but poorly provided
with weapons proper for the purpose, and withal
unskilled in the use of them.  In descending from
the top of the hill, there was but one narrow defile
by which they could escape, and there they floundered
for nearly half an hour, tumbling over each
other three or four deep, until at last they got into
their native element.
</p>

<p>
The north side of the Lobos Islands affords a
fine harbour, where we saw a small vessel at
anchor waiting for the proceeds of her cargo, which
had been landed on the coast at a place called
Lambayaca.
</p>

<p>
On the 26th of August, we anchored at Peyta,
in latitude five degrees south.  This was the last
place at which it would be convenient for us to
stop, and here, to our gratification, we were
enabled to obtain the necessary refreshments for our
cruise.  We filled the deck with pigs, poultry, and
vegetables, and at considerable expense succeeded,
after much trouble, in obtaining a supply of good
water.  Peyta is situated in a deep bay, and is a
good harbour, formed by two projecting points of
land, and is for many leagues surrounded by
barren sand.  It is the seaport of an interior city,
called Pieura, and receives from distant valleys
all that is necessary for the consumption of the
inhabitants or strangers, who visit it for the
purposes of trade.  It is supplied with water from
a river that empties itself into the sea, near a
small Indian town called Golan, whence we found
it necessary to resort for a supply.  When we
had proceeded there, and anchored our vessel
within a mile or two of the town, the only method
by which we could obtain water, was to have it
brought in calabashes on mules.  It was their
saint's day, and in the village all was frolic and
mirth.  Groups of men and women were everywhere
seen, dressed fantastically, singing and
dancing along the streets.  I called upon the
governor, who was a white man, very early in the
morning, to report the arrival of our vessel, and
the object of our visit.  He had just risen from his
hammock, and received me with many expressions
of civility, and proffers of assistance.  His house
was but little better than that of the captain of the
port of Santa, and his appearance not more
prepossessing.  The room into which I was ushered
had no other floor than the ground beaten hard,
on which were several large piles of pumpkins,
bags of beans, and Indian corn, which he proposed
to sell me before our official interview had ended.
Immediately after breakfast he came on board to
visit the captain, bringing with him several emales.
They remained on board nearly all day, to the
annoyance of every body, and in the evening were
removed to the shore with great difficulty, so freely
had they partaken of our hospitality.  Soon after
our arrival at Peyta, we were invited to dine with
the governor, who treated us with great kindness
and hospitality.  Some months previous to our
arrival, his son had shipped himself at Talcahuana,
on board of the Dolphin, as a common sailor, and
was discharged on our arrival here, and permitted
to remain with his friends.  He was spoken of
amongst us as a person who had been compelled
to fly from his home for improper conduct of some
kind, and now the whole mystery was explained.
His father was one of the most respectable and
patriotic men in the place where he resided; but
this son was a youth of a bad disposition, and had
given him a great deal of trouble.  When the
revolution first commenced in that section of the
country, he provided himself with the uniform of
a patriot officer, and went about the country,
where he was a stranger, or but slightly known,
and under the authority of his pretended commission,
took, by violence, the cattle and horses of the
farmers, or whatever else he could possess himself
of, which he converted into money for his own
purposes.  Sometimes he even pressed the Indians
as soldiers, and compelled them to assist him in
carrying off his plunder.
</p>

<p>
At length, his exactions became so heavy, and
were levied so tyrannically, that a gentleman
resisted him, and questioned the legality of his
authority.  Numbers were fired with indignation
against him, and the propriety of his conduct was
no sooner questioned, than the investigation was
followed up with such activity, that, finding there
was no safety but in flight, he preferred a voluntary
exile to meeting the just resentment of the people
he had injured.  He had suffered many hardships
during his absence, and appeared on his return to
be truly penitent.  I was at his father's house
when he entered.  His mother and sisters were
deeply affected, and received him with all the
tenderness of female sympathy, their eyes
overflowing with tears.  They each embraced him, as
one most dear to them; but when he approached
his father (a man about sixty) who was standing
on the opposite side of the room, he caught the
old man's eye bent indignantly upon him, and
turned away with a look humbled to the dust.
</p>

<p>
Whilst lying here we had an opportunity of
witnessing a solitary instance of an enterprising
disposition in a Peruvian Indian,&mdash;a characteristic,
it is believed, they but rarely possess, or, at most,
but in a slight degree.  We had on board an Indian
youth, who belonged to this part of Peru, and
for several days had held frequent conversations
with his countrymen, who were attracted on board
by curiosity.  One of these people had concerted
with the youth a plan for his deserting.  In
compliance with this arrangement, he put off, during
the mid-watch, with his canoe, and taking his
station just ahead of the Dolphin, gave a shrill whistle
as the signal of his approach.  The lad, fearing
that he might be detected, did not venture to
answer the signal, which was repeated several times,
when the officer of the watch suspecting the
object, gave the long expected response, and the
credulous Indian came cautiously paddling close
under the bow of the vessel, where, to his
amazement, he was made prisoner, and compelled to go
on board.  When the captain came on deck the
next morning, he punished the poor Indian, by
impressing upon him the belief that he intended to
detain, and make a soldier of him.  Not having
sagacity enough to know the difference between
our vessel and a patriot man-of-war, and conceiving
that there was no chance for his escape, he
made the most pathetic appeals to the captain's
humanity, and appeared to suffer all the agony of
despair.  The captain ordered a cartridge-box to
be put over his shoulders, and a musket placed in
his hands.
</p>

<p>
He seemed frantic with the reality of his servitude,
using his utmost violence to disengage himself
from the cartridge-box and musket, declaring
again and again that he was no soldier, and in the
most affecting manner begging the captain for
God's sake to permit him to go on shore.  When
his tormentors discontinued their persecutions, he
jumped over the stern into his canoe, with great
activity, and soon joined his anxious friends on the
beach, who had assembled there, apprehensive of
his captivity, and awaiting the result.
</p>

<p>
On the 2d of September, we sailed from Peyta,
and shaped our course for the Gallapagos Islands.
The trade wind was moderate, accompanied with
fine weather.  On the morning of the 6th, we
made Hood's Island, and in a few hours
afterwards, anchored on the west side, in a small
harbour, called Gardner's Bay, the only one it
affords.  After dinner, the captain took with him
twenty or thirty of the crew, and went in pursuit
of turtle.  The island is high and mountainous,
covered everywhere with volcanic cinders, many
of which are in huge masses.  The men were at
first very eager in their search for turtle, and the
whole crew, if they had been permitted, would
gladly have engaged in it.
</p>

<p>
They expected to have found the turtle near the
shore; instead of which they had to scramble over
rocks and climb mountains, half the time making
their way through brambles, at the expense of
scratches and torn clothes.  Men were never more
disappointed than our crew in the amusement
of catching turtle.  Sometimes they would wander
about for hours before they found one, and then it
would probably be a mile or two from the beach,
and as much as a man could well lift.  By sundown
we had collected about thirty, of large size.
Black grouper were very abundant close to our
anchorage, but the sharks were so numerous that
for every fish taken we lost one or two hooks.  We
got a plentiful supply for the crew, however, in the
course of an hour.  On the following morning, we
joined Captain Meek, of the brig Tamahamah,
which vessel had accompanied us hither, and
making a large party&mdash;went round the island about
ten or twelve miles from our anchorage, where
we expected to find turtle more abundant.  The
captain was an old cruiser here, and well
calculated to make one of an agreeable party.  He
stood cook for us, and as the day was very warm,
our first essay on landing, was to make a large
bower, under which to prepare our dinner.  The
people then dispersed, to look for turtle, the first
of which were served up for our dinner, in a
style that might have been relished by less keen
appetites than ours, which were sharpened by
laborious exercise.  At night, we had collected
upwards of a hundred, besides ten large green
turtle, we were so fortunate as to find on the
beach near the place of our landing.  When we
came to assemble our men to return on board, two
of them were missing, and upon inquiry were
ascertained to have been absent nearly all day.
We dispersed and looked for them in every
direction until dark, when every body being much
fatigued, a party was left to search for them again
in the morning, and the rest repaired on board.
In the morning, we renewed our labours without
success, and with great reason began to feel
seriously alarmed for the safety of our shipmates.
There was no water on the island, and the
preceding day had been so extremely warm, that we
feared the poor fellows would soon perish, if they
had not already.  Our search, too, was attended
with considerable danger.  Wandering about in
distant parts of the island, we sometimes, in
clambering over rocks and mountains, changed our
course without being sensible of it, and would find
ourselves pursuing our way in a different direction
from what we supposed.  In the afternoon, when
our strength and patience were quite exhausted,
and our parties returning for the night, the lost
men suddenly appeared on the beach, close to the
vessel.  They were pale and emaciated, with
scarcely strength to move one foot before the
other.  Their clothes were in tatters, and their
shoes worn off their feet, which were very much
crippled with their long journey over the sharp
cinders.  It appeared from the story of these men,
that they had several times been on the side of
the island where we were anchored, but upon an
eminence that overlooked the vessel, and thinking
themselves on the other side, recrossed; when, to
their astonishment, seeing nothing of her, they
would retrace their steps; and in this manner,
were wandering about for many hours, almost
despairing at last of finding relief.  While they
were in this wretched situation, they several times
quenched their thirst by killing turtle that came in
their way, and drinking from the reservoir with
which nature has supplied this singular animal.
I have since been told by a seaman, that he deserted
from a whale ship at these islands, accompanied
by a number of others, and that for weeks, they
had no other water than what they obtained by
breaking open the turtles and drinking of the
water they found in them.  It is contained in a
pouch that resembles a bladder, and is immediately
connected with the stomach.  It is large in
proportion to the size of the animal, and some of
them will hold two or three gallons.  It surprised
us to see the tameness of the birds.  They would
scarcely fly from us when we approached them
within a few feet, and in many instances we could
pick them up with our hands.  The gannet, generally
of a clear white, and as large as a goose, we
could catch with great ease; and the albatrosses,
some grey and some yellow, which were much
larger than any bird we have in the United States,
would but rarely rise upon the wing to escape us.
They ran very fast, and would sometimes give us
a chase of one or two hundred yards.  A bird,
the plumage and form of which differed in no
respect from our mocking-bird, would feed within a
few feet of us, and the turtle-doves were killed in
great numbers by our people, with short poles.
Hood's Island is evidently of volcanic origin.  It
is, indeed, nothing but a mass of cinders.  It is
covered with a slight growth of scrubby bushes
of various kinds, and occasionally a tree of four or
five inches in diameter, is met with.  Of all its
vegetation, the cactus seems best adapted to it.  There
is a variety of the species; one of which attains
to a larger size than any other production of the
island, and spreads out into a tree of considerable
height.  This kind of the cactus is chosen by the
turtle for food.  When the whalers, or other visiters,
go to the Gallapagos Islands for these animals,
they cut down a number of the trees in the evening,
and on the following morning they are sure
to find turtle feeding there, although none could
be seen in its vicinity on the preceding day.  The
guanas are not the least remarkable of the inhabitants
of the Gallapagos.  They are from two to
three feet long and shaped like a lizard.  Their
colour varies from grey to jet black.  They are
easily caught and quite harmless; are often
eaten and said to be excellent.  On the top of the
head they have a beautiful shining crest of black
and yellow, which, in the sun, has a most brilliant
appearance.
</p>

<p>
Except where we anchored, a heavy surf breaks
all round Hood's Island.  In a high and central
part of it, is a place which resembles the dry bed
of a small lake.  It is surrounded by ridges and
peaks of cinders rising in some places from one to
three hundred feet, and in all probability has been
the crater of a volcano.  In places difficult of
access we saw a few seals, but so shy that with
the exception of one or two instances, we could
not approach them.  The few that we killed were
hair seal, and consequently of but little value.
Between Hood's Island and the small one that
forms the harbour, there is a passage for ships,
but it is very narrow, and with a strong current
that runs through it, which would always render
it dangerous for a ship to attempt to pass,
particularly so if the wind were not perfectly fair.
</p>

<p>
At one, P.M., on the 10th of September, we got
underway, and stood over for Charles Island,
where we anchored at six, in Essex Bay.  Rock
Dismal, so called by Commodore Porter, is an
excellent land mark, and seems to have been
appropriately named.  It rises to the eastward of Essex
Bay, in sharp crags of fifty to a hundred feet high.
A few solitary bushes constitute all its vegetation.
In approaching Essex Bay, and at its entrance,
we were alarmed several times by a strong ripple,
but in casting the lead found no bottom with ten
fathoms of line.  At Essex Bay, is the celebrated
post-office of the whalers, to which Commodore
Porter resorted several times during his cruise
for information.  We found a letter there left by
a whaler who had visited Charles Island for a
supply of turtle.  He was last from the river Tumbez,
where one of his crew had caught a fever, of
which he died.  Two others lost their way in the
mountains of Charles Island, where, after
wandering about for a considerable time, one of them
complained to his companion of a head-ache, and
soon after sat down and died.  The other found
his way to the ship after a great deal of suffering.
</p>

<p>
Charles Island is high and mountainous, and like
Hood's, is covered with a thin growth of bushes.
At the distance of a mile from the beach there is a
small spring of water, to which there is a footpath
over the crags and hills, worn by visiters in search
of turtle, a scanty supply of which can only be
obtained with great labour.  The residence of
Pat, the Irishman, in this lone and dreary place,
for a number of years, has made it an object of
curiosity to all who visit the island.  Here he
planted his potatoes and pumpkins, and raised
his chickens; administering the government of his
island with despotic sway, for Pat was a monarch
although he pillowed his head upon a rock, and
reposed his rude limbs on a bed made of bushes.
The story is known to all who have read Commodore
Porter's journal, in which he gives an account
of Pat's residence on this island, and of his
possessing himself of the person and services of a black
man belonging to a whale ship, who had strayed
too far from his companions, and whom Pat held
in durance for a long time.
</p>

<p>
At ten, A.M., we parted company with the
Tamahamah, and sailed for the Marqueses Islands.
The turtle with which our deck was covered, were
very troublesome and offensive for about a week,
when they became quite domesticated and gave us
not the slightest inconvenience.  For two or
three weeks we served them to the crew constantly,
in lieu of the usual allowance of salt provisions.
It was a most valuable substitute, and important to
us, as we were bound upon a long cruise, as well
for the health of the crew as for the preservation
of our sea stock.  When the number became
comparatively small, we discontinued the general use
of them, and served them only once or twice a
week.  We never fed them, and for aught I could
see, they were equally as fat and healthy a month
after they were taken on board, as on the first day.
As a sea stock nothing can be more convenient or
better calculated for a long cruise.  They may be
put any where and kept in almost any way, and if
it should be thought advisable to feed them, there
is scarcely any vegetable substance that they
will not eat after they are a little domesticated.
The liver of this turtle is particularly delicious.
When fried, it is not unlike a fine oyster, and
although partaken very freely of, no ill effect
is ever experienced from it.  Sixteen days after
leaving Charles Island, we made the island
Rooahooga, one of the southernmost of the
Marqueses group.  The wind was fresh and blew
steadily from the southward and eastward,
accompanied by a heavy swell.  As we approached the
islands, we had some rainy and cloudy weather,
but with this exception, our whole passage was
attended with clear days and fine moonlight nights.
In latitude three degrees south, and longitude
ninety-five degrees west, we observed a remarkable
appearance in the water, which, had we been
navigating an unfrequented ocean, would have
very much alarmed us.  At several different times
during the day, on September 12th, we passed
through violent rips, and at times nearly the whole
ocean assumed the appearance and agitation of
boiling water.
</p>

<p>
Throughout our passage, we remarked, that
whenever the wind hauled to the southward of
southeast, it increased in force.  It occurred so
frequently as to be a subject of general remark.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th of September, in latitude seven
degrees fifty minutes south, and longitude one
hundred and twenty degrees thirty minutes west, we
saw a comet for the first time, thirty or forty
degrees above the horizon, and bearing from us east
by north.  At day-light, on the morning of
September 26th, several of the southernmost of the
Marqueses were in sight.  They were all
mountainous, but covered with vegetation, and as we
drew near presented a pleasing contrast to the
sterile and gloomy Gallapagos.  We stood along
the shore of La Dominica, admiring the beautiful
little valleys that were presented to our view in
quick succession, where villages of palm-thatched
huts, surrounded by clumps of tall cocoa-nut and
wide-spreading bread fruit trees, formed scenes of
rural quiet calculated to fill the imagination with
the most agreeable conceptions of the happy
condition of their inhabitants.  At length we came to
a small bay where the valley was more populous
than any we had seen before, and the captain, to
our great satisfaction, hauled up for it and stood
close in towards the island.  We lowered a boat,
and providing ourselves with a few trifles for
presents, pulled into the bay within a few yards of
the shore.  The beach was already thronged with
people of all ages, male and female, who invited
us to land by the most significant gestures, whilst
many of them were singing and dancing to express
their joy.  The surrounding rocks and hills were
covered with groups of females, gaily decked off
with their neat head-dresses of the white Tapa
cloth and many-coloured robes, which were floating
in the wind, half concealing and half exposing
their fantastically painted limbs.  When they saw
that we would not land, the men and boys dashed
into the water with whatever they had to offer us,
and swam off to the boat.  A chief, who had a dry
wreath of cocoa-nut around his brows, came off
with them; and, upon being invited, got into the
boat, where he remained until our departure,
apparently giving orders from time to time to those
who were passing and repassing from the shore to
the boat.  In a few minutes, they had presented us
with a considerable quantity of cocoa-nuts, bananas,
and papayas, for which we gave them in return
a few trifling articles, the most valuable of which
were glass beads.  The chief had his eyes
constantly fixed upon our fire-arms, and finally gave
us to understand, by motions, that a pistol would
be acceptable to him.  With this intimation we
could not comply; but he bore the refusal with
great good nature, and for some time after our
store of little presents was exhausted, his people
continued to bring us off fruit without the
expectation of any return.  When they found that we
were serious in our refusal to land, the women
came from the hills and assembled on the rocks
close to us, where, in a nearer view, they could
display their persons to more advantage, and charm
us with the melody of their voices.  There they
all joined in songs, keeping time by clapping their
hands, stopping occasionally to receive the
applause of the men and to invite us on shore.
Several of them, male and female, swam off to the
boat; and when we were about to depart, insisted
so strongly upon going on board with us that we
had to use some violence to get clear of them.
</p>

<p>
We continued on in the afternoon, soon passing
La Dominica, and at sundown made Rooahooga
ahead.  The weather being squally and the island
only fifteen miles from us, we lay by for the night.
At daylight, we found ourselves a few miles distant
from the middle of the south side of the island,
where a bay presented itself, which, at a distance,
promised to afford anchorage.  On a nearer
approach, however, its appearance changed, and
as there were but few signs of inhabitants, we ran
along toward the west end of the island.  This
part of it had not much appearance of fertility,
although we saw a few large trees.  It is high,
broken, and indented with a number of small bays,
none of which are large enough to form a harbour.
In rounding the southwest point of the island we
had sudden and violent gusts of wind.  Invisible
Bay is situated a little to the westward of this
point, and although it has somewhat the appearance
of a harbour, and presents to view a beautiful
sand beach, we saw no indications of inhabitants.
About ten miles to the north, we anchored
in twenty fathoms water, having rocky
bottom, and an inaccessible rocky shore where
the surf breaks violently.  The captain and
several officers went back to Invisible Bay in one of
the boats, and in a cave close to the shore they
found five or six natives, who at their approach,
fled to the hills, making signs for our people to
depart.  In the cave, they found a few fishing-nets.
They tried to prevail upon the natives to
come near, but their demonstrations of friendship
were answered only by motions expressive of
hostility.  The landing was difficult, as the shore was
rocky, and a considerable surf broke upon it,
although the bay was tolerably protected by
a projecting point.  Soon after meridian, we got
under way and shaped our course for Nooaheeva,
which was plainly in sight from Rooahooga.
We stood along, with a fine breeze and clear
weather, and at three, P.M., rounded the
north-eastern extremity of Nooaheeva, when a spacious
harbour, called Comptroller's Bay, opened to our
view.  It is about three miles deep, and at its
inner extremity are two projecting points that
extend out for more than a mile, and form three
small harbours.  We were no sooner observed by
the natives on shore, than they put off in a number
of large canoes and pulled with great rapidity
towards us.  The wind was light and baffling,
and we advanced slowly into the harbour.  In
a few minutes, we were surrounded by canoes,
containing from six to eight men each.  They
belonged to different tribes, which they attempted to
explain to us with great earnestness of speech and
gesture, but as we had no one on board who knew
much of the language, we were greatly at a loss
to comprehend their meaning.  They had not
followed us long when two of the canoes came along
side, one on each quarter, and the men crawled up
the side and perched themselves upon the
hammocks, like so many monkeys, where they called
out in a loud voice, addressing themselves alternately
to us and to the natives on the side of the
vessel opposite to them,&mdash;one party exclaiming
"Mattee, mattee, Typee!" and the other "Mattee,
mattee,[<a id="chap01fn4text"></a><a href="#chap01fn4">4</a>] Happah!" and occasionally using angry
gestures with the exclamation.  This was too
expressive for us not to understand.  They belonged
to different tribes, the Typee, and Happah; and
were mutually trying to prejudice us against the
tribe to which they did not belong, in order to
induce us to anchor in their own bay.  Both the
bays were beautiful, but as the Happahs' was the
most populous and nearest to us, we gave it the
preference; and a little before sunset anchored
in twenty fathoms water within a cable's length
of the shore.  The Typees no sooner saw that
we were standing in for the Happah Bay, than
they hurried into their canoe and paddled off for
their village as fast as they could.  The Happah
valley was a romantic spot.  A plain, a league or
two in circumference, stretched back to the mountains
in a semicircular form, presenting in front a
clear white sand beach about a mile long.  The
plain was covered with cocoa-nuts, with
bread-fruit interspersed, and near enough to form a
continued shade without presenting the appearance
of a dense forest.  Scattered about every
where through these trees were the palm-thatched
habitations of the natives.  In the rear of the
plain, the mountains rose precipitously, forming
an insuperable barrier against the incursions of
other tribes.  The land rose gently to the left, but
it was almost barren and added nothing to the
beauty of the landscape.  On the extreme right,
a considerable mountain and a point projecting far
out into the bay, separated the Happahs from the
tribes that lived beyond them in that direction.
Nothing could equal the apparent joy of the
natives when they saw us anchored in front of their
village.  The whole tribe, which probably did
not exceed five hundred, flocked down to the
beach, expressing their satisfaction by dancing
and singing.  Hundreds of them dashed into the
water and swam off to us, so that we had not
time to furl sails and clear the deck before the
vessel was crowded with people.  To show them
that we had the means of making successful
resistance against any hostile intention they might
adopt, we paraded our musketeers upon the deck
and practised them, a ceremony that appeared
to afford the natives very great amusement.
We allowed them to remain on board until the
dusk of evening, when the number being so great
as to make the vessel uncomfortable, and
apprehending that in the course of the night they might
appropriate to themselves many things that they
would find about the deck, and which could not
conveniently be spared, we sent most of them on
shore.  The chiefs and a few others who expressed
a great desire to remain, were permitted to
pass the night with us.
</p>

<p>
On the following day, I took a few presents with
me and went over to the Typee valley, to visit
that tribe, celebrated as the most warlike of
Nooaheeva.  As soon as the boat was perceived,
the people came running towards the beach in
every direction, and before she reached the shore
we were surrounded by great numbers, who
plunged into the water and swam off to us.  As
many as we could conveniently accommodate
were permitted to get into the boat, where they
treated me so unceremoniously that I did not think
it prudent to land.  Amongst those who paid me
a visit was a chief of the tribe.  He was a man
about thirty years of age, well-featured and of fine
proportions.  His deportment was grave and dignified,
but like the rest of our new acquaintances,
who swam off to us, he was quite naked except a
slight covering about his loins.  The common
people treated him with great deference, and never
intruded upon that part of the boat where he was
seated.  He made us understand that he wished to
obtain muskets and powder, for the purchase of
which he had caused five or six large hogs to be
brought down, that were tied and laying on the
shore.  I offered him whatever else I had that I
thought would induce him to part with them; but
he obstinately refused any other consideration than
muskets and powder.  Large quantities of cocoa-nuts,
bananas, and papayas were thrown into the
boat by the people who were swimming around
us, and when we had been lying there an hour,
we had as many in the boat as we could
conveniently carry.  I had a variety of presents,
such as beads, buttons, &amp;c., all of which the
common people were very anxious to obtain; but the
chief would take nothing from me of less consequence
than fire-arms or gunpowder.  I offered
him flints and musket balls, which, although of
great value amongst the natives, he would not
receive.  He invited me frequently, with great
earnestness of manner, to land, until he found,
by my repeated refusals, that I was determined to
remain in my boat.
</p>

<p>
The bay of the Typees was rather smaller than
that of the Happah tribe.  They live principally
upon the side of a mountain that rises gently from
the shore.  The number of the tribe appeared to
be about the same as that of the Happahs.  Their
houses are situated in circular chains of villages,
rising one above the other, from the base to near
the top of the mountain, where it terminates in
rude and uninhabitable cliffs.  Groves and clumps
of cocoa-nut, and bread-fruit trees are every
where interspersed with the dwellings, and the
mind of the observer being impressed with the idea
of their usefulness to the natives, gives a double
effect to the beautiful landscape adorned by their
waving tops and broad green leaves.  We had
several occasions to remark the inveterate dislike
that the Typees and Happahs entertained towards
each other.
</p>

<p>
On the morning after our arrival, the sailing-master
went on shore in the Happah valley to obtain
an altitude of the sun by the artificial horizon
He was shy of the natives, as we all were at first,
and apprehending that some of them might approach
him with a hostile intention, while his back
was turned towards them, and having heard that
they held in great reverence a place said to be
Tabooed, or consecrated, he made a circle round
his place observation, and told the natives, who
had followed him in great numbers, that the space
within the circle was Tabooed.  They stared at
him in silence and stood back from it; but by and
by, when he was intently engaged in getting his
altitude, one of the natives, supposing that he was
employed in some plan (to him incomprehensible)
to destroy the Typees, as he turned the face of his
sextant in that direction, crawled up gently behind
the sailing-master, without being perceived by
him, and suddenly tapping him two or three times
on the shoulder, exclaimed with great energy,
"Mattee, mattee, Typee!"  It may readily be
supposed that his imagination, which was very
much excited before, was not soothed by this
salutation.  He turned upon the native, expressing in
look and manner his consternation and displeasure,
which was only met by the delighted Indian with
a repetition of "Mattee, mattee, Typee!"
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 25th, I went on shore,
in company with several of the officers, to indulge
our curiosity and ramble about the valley.  We
were soon surrounded by a group of natives, who
followed us wherever we went.  Our first object
was to visit the chief of the valley, whose residence
we found at the distance of two or three hundred
yards from the shore.  It was a plain, oblong hut,
thirty by twenty feet.  Its simple structure was
such as is first suggested to the untutored
mind&mdash;a few poles laid over crotches, upon which was
framed a triangular roof, and the whole thatched
with palm or cocoa-nut leaves.  When we entered
this regal hut we found the chief seated near
one end of it, who barely condescended to notice
us as we approached to make our salutations.  We
were not prepared for so rude a reception and felt
somewhat mortified to find a chief of his distinguished
rank so totally destitute of courtesy.  We
thought at least that he would have risen from
his sitting posture, and expected more from him
than our after experience taught us we had a right
to look for from people in a state of nature.  The
only furniture in the hut was a few coarse mats.
At one side of it five muskets, highly polished,
were arranged one above the other, over which
hung two kegs of powder sewed up in canvass,
and near them a few long spears and a war conch,
ornamented with human hair.  We made ourselves
as much at home as if we had received a
more cordial welcome, and indulged our curiosity
in examining whatever we saw, when suddenly
the chief rose and his silence and gravity were at
once explained.  We had remarked that he had
an uncommonly large black robe thrown over
him, but without the least suspicion that it covered
any one else than himself.  He suddenly threw it
aside as we came near him and there stood his
wife, a girl about eighteen years of age, who had
just finished making her toilet.  He pointed to
her with a look of satisfaction, and uttered
"Motake," a word we afterwards learned, signified
very good, or very well.  Although she was
naturally a pretty girl, she had made herself a
hideous looking object.  She had smeared her
face all over with a coarse yellow paint, upon
which was drawn streaks of black and green,
than which nothing could have appeared more
disgusting.  She assumed a manner and look of
affectation, such as may often have been observed
in some self-approving beauty, who, conscious of
her charms, feels that she is an object of
admiration to all around her.  When I expressed my
disapprobation of her style of ornament, she stared
at me with a look of surprise, which seemed to ask
what I was saying.  I soon gave both her and the
chief to understand, by signs; after which they
seemed not so well pleased with themselves or
each other; and when I saw her again in the
evening she was without any ornament, and looked
all the better for it.  While here, two grotesque
figures came in and walked up to me with an
austere look.  They had a profusion of cock's
feathers bound circularly round their brows, broad
gorgets of wood ornamented with red berries
round their necks, shell bracelets and ornaments
of polished shell or bone tied above their ancles.
Each held in his hand a fan of palmetto.  After
standing a few moments, keeping their eyes fixed
upon me, they began jumping up and down and
fanning themselves, applying both hands to the
fan.  My first feeling was surprise, mingled with
curiosity, to know the cause of their strange
appearance; but when they had several times
repeated their exercise, the scene was altogether so
ridiculous that I could not refrain from laughing.
They soon afterwards, without even noticing the
chief, turned and walked off.  After leaving the
hut of the chief, I visited a number of others, all
of which were nearly alike.  In one of them I saw
two drums, the only instruments of music that I
met with.  The largest of them was a hollow log,
from three to four feet long, and about a foot and
a half in diameter, covered at both ends with shark
skin.  I asked the owner to play upon it, to which
he readily consented, seeming highly flattered
with the invitation.  He accompanied his voice
by thumping his hands and elbows on the drum-head;
but the music that he made was intolerable.
He beat, however, in very good time, and
had evidently a high opinion of his performance.
</p>

<p>
In the course of our ramble, one of the officers
told an Indian, who had joined us, by signs, that
he wanted some cocoa-nuts.  The good-natured
fellow acquiesced without the least hesitation, and
to our great astonishment, ran up a tree standing
near us, with the activity of a squirrel.  The tree
was forty or fifty feet high, having but a slight
inclination, yet the climbing seemed to occasion
him scarcely any exertion.  They do not press
their bodies against the tree and hitch themselves
up as is customary with us, which, in their naked
condition, they could not do without injury.  They
press the bottoms of their feet against the tree,
and clinging to it with their hands one above the
other, ascend upon all-fours.  It did not strike us
with less surprise when he had thrown the cocoa-nuts
down, to see with what facility he stripped
off the hard husks without the aid of any thing
but his teeth.  For such a thing to have been
accomplished by one of us would be found impossible.
We afterwards remarked the same practise
in other places, and at other islands.  It was
general except with the old men, who, unless they
were very robust, used a sharp-pointed stick of
hard wood to remove the husk.
</p>

<p>
They could not understand our practice of
shaking hands.  When we extended a hand to one
of them as a mark of friendly salutation, they
looked as though they would question what was
meant by it; and from their manner seemed to
think that our object was to feel their skin, which
they would always reciprocate by raising up our
sleeves and examining very minutely.
</p>

<p>
On the morning of the 29th of September, which
was the last of our remaining in Comptroller's
Bay, I made another excursion to the Typee Bay,
taking with me the chief of the Happahs, who was
very anxious to go.  I wondered at this, as the
tribes evinced so much dislike to each other; but
afterwards saw, in my intercourse with the natives
of the South Sea Islands, that uncivilized men are
capable of as much duplicity towards each other
as the educated and refined.  When we had
arrived within a hundred yards of the shore we
were met by the chief with whom I had formed an
acquaintance on the preceding day.  He saluted
the chief of the Happahs in a way that indicated a
former acquaintance, but with a look and manner
somewhat formal.  The Typee chief immediately
spoke to some one near him, who ran off and in
a few minutes returned with a calabash filled with
a preparation of the bread-fruit, upon which was
poured a quantity of milk expressed from a
cocoa-nut.  This was offered by the Typee to the
Happah chief, and I was also invited to partake of
it.  I tasted and found it very palatable.  The
two chiefs seated themselves in the stern of the
boat, and made a hearty breakfast, using their
fingers instead of spoons.  Neither of them seemed
very communicative, as only a few words passed
between them at this interview.  There was also
in the boat a young woman belonging to the
chief's family, for whom breakfast was brought
in the shell of a cocoa-nut, and which was a
preparation of the cocoa-nut and bread-fruit, sour and
disagreeable to the taste.  This, I was informed,
is the food upon which the women almost entirely
subsist, they being Tabooed from eating whatever
is held in high estimation by the men.  When
the chiefs had finished their repast, the Typee
pointed to his hogs, which he had again caused to
be brought down upon the beach, saying that he
wanted powder or guns for them, but unfortunately
I had neither of these valuable articles with which
to make an exchange with him, and he would
consider nothing else as an equivalent.  He sent for
several old muskets that were very much out of
order, and proposed to go on board with me and
have them repaired, making me understand by
signs, that he would in return present me with
hogs.  His anxiety was so great upon this subject,
that I found it difficult to put a stop to his
solicitations.  In the mean time, however, I saw the
schooner underway, and dismissing my Typee
friends, pulled away for the Happah Bay.  When
I had approached within half a mile of the
Happah village, the schooner was almost out of the
harbour, and the chief observing that I was
anxious to get on board, proposed jumping into the
water and swimming home, to which I readily
consented.  He then stripped himself of his neck
and ear ornaments, which consisted of two white
pieces of polished shell and a carved image of
bone, and presenting them to me as a token of his
regard, plunged into the water, leaving me free
to pursue my way to the vessel without the
trouble of landing him.  Most of the ornaments worn
by these people, are of bone or shells, finely
polished or rudely carved.  They attach a number
of them to a piece of cocoa-nut twine, and wear
them around their necks, or wrists, or ancles, as
may be most agreeable to the taste and fancy of
the individuals.  A more expensive and difficult
ornament to obtain is a gorget.  It is a piece of
wood, semi-circular, about three inches wide,
carved to fit the neck, covered with a beautiful
red and black berry, and stuck on with a gum that
oozes from the tree of the bread-fruit.  On the
hill that rises to the left of the valley, we planted
a variety of seeds of fruit, vegetables and grain,
but the natives of the valley are so totally ignorant
of every thing that relates to agriculture, that
it is not probable they will ever derive any
advantage from them.  Whilst we were in Happah Bay,
the weather was clear and delightful.  The
temperature so regular that no change was felt in
the transition from day to night.
</p>

<p>
On the 30th of September, we stood out of
Comptroller's Bay, and ran down for Massachusetts'
Bay, a place made familiar to our countrymen
by Commodore Porter's long and interesting
visit.  The two points that form the harbours of
Comptroller's and Massachusetts' Bays, are about
seven miles distant from each other.  At one,
P.M., we were clear of the projecting southern
point of Comptroller's Bay, and at three, P.M.,
anchored in eight fathoms water, within half a
mile of the hill at the bottom of the bay, called
Porter's Monument.  Before we came to anchor,
the water was covered with canoes, and people of
both sexes and all ages swimming towards us, and
as soon as the vessel lost her head way, they were
crawling up on all sides like so many rats.  They
were not less delighted with our arrival than were
the Happahs.  Hundreds were collected on the
shore, and all expressing their satisfaction by songs
and dances.  Amongst our first visitors, were two
English sailors who had deserted from whale
ships, and been long enough resident on the island
to converse in the language of the natives.  With
them came also a native of Nooaheeva, and a
native of Otaheite, both of whom had served a
considerable time in whale ships, and could converse
in broken English.  We were therefore in no
want of interpreters, and it seemed at once to
introduce us to the confidence and friendship of our
new acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
The harbour of Massachusetts' Bay is spacious
and affords good anchorage for ships of the largest
class.  The only part of it, however, where
landing is not attended with difficulty and some
danger, is the east side, where there is a fine sand
beach from a quarter to half a mile long, at one
extremity of which empties a small rivulet of pure
and excellent water into the bay.  Landing may
be effected at the watering-place beyond Porter's
Monument, where there is a more considerable
stream of fresh water, but it is always difficult, and
when the surf is high, cannot fail to be dangerous.
At this place we watered the Dolphin; but had
to swim the casks to and from the shore, and
altogether, it was a laborious undertaking.  Along
the east and north part of the bay there is a long
reef that makes at a short distance from the shore,
upon which a heavy surf is always breaking.  In
entering the bay, the whole habitable part of this
section of the island is presented at one view, and
forms a most grand and beautiful landscape.  It is
nearly semi-circular, and rises like an amphitheatre,
in fruitful and populous circular ranges of hills,
until at the distance of several miles, it terminates
in a circumference of high and gloomy mountains,
the tops of which resemble a massive wall.  This
rude and barren circle of mountain contrasts finely
with the fertile ranges below, covered with their
forests of cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees, and
huts and villages every where scattered about
through hill and dale.  Nor is the extreme
elevation without its interest and beauty.  A number
of little cataracts reflecting the rays of the sun
and looking like sheets of liquid silver, break in
upon the gloom of the sterile rock, adding
brilliancy as they descend to the lively prospect
below.  After a shower, not less than fifty of these
splendid falls of water may be seen, some of which
are but just perceptible through the intervening
space between hills and trees, producing an effect
peculiarly agreeable.  What is called Porter's
Monument, is a round hill from fifty to an hundred
feet high, situated at the east extremity of the
bay.  It was here that Commodore Porter had his
Fort, not a vestige of which is now remaining.  It
is overrun with a wild luxuriant growth of vines
and grass, and no trace of a footstep can be found.
On one side of the hill, near its base, was stretched
a bark line, which was attended by a man who
calls himself Opotee, and who declares the hill
beyond it to be tabooed.  Upon one occasion, as I
was approaching it, some natives called out
"Taboo, Taboo!" but Opotee immediately expressed
his willingness that I should pass, as I was a
countryman of his namesake, Opotee.  To the
north of Porter's Monument, and back from the
sand beach, where was the navy-yard, all is now
overgrown with bushes and trees, some of which
have attained to a considerable size.  Like the
monument, there is no indication of its ever having
been occupied for any human purpose,
</p>

<p>
On the first of October, the day after our arrival,
I went on shore, taking with me a great variety
of seeds, for the purpose of planting them where
it was most probable they would be taken care of
and come to maturity.  The natives flocked round
me in great numbers.  There was not less than a
hundred boys with the crowd of men and women
that followed me.  They were highly delighted
when they discovered my object, which was
explained to them by John Luxon, the native of
Nooaheeva, who spoke English.  Whenever we came
to a rough or muddy place, which was frequently
the case, the boys and men, notwithstanding my
remonstrances, would mount me on their shoulders
and carry me over, with loud shouting.  I could
easily perceive that this was a frolic with those
who engaged in it, and done out of levity and the
caprice of the moment; but I could not but feel
that they had been first stimulated to it by the
favourable impression they had conceived of my
design.  I planted some things in unfrequented
places where I found a clear spot, but most of the
seeds and fruit-pits, in the enclosures of the
natives.  John Luxon was a man of some rank as a
chief, and possessed considerable property.  To
one of his enclosures that was large and seemed
to have been attended with unusual care, I
devoted most of my attention.  There, aided by
several of the natives, who laboured with great
assiduity, I prepared the ground and made quite an
extensive plantation of orange, lemon, cheromaya,
peach, apricot, water-melons, pumpkins, potatoes,
onions, beans, corn, and a variety of other fruits
and grain, from Peru.  He expressed himself in
terms of the warmest gratitude, and I have no
doubt that the natives have already experienced
the most important benefits from the memento I
left them of the Dolphin's visit to their Island.
</p>

<p>
In the course of my days' occupation, I was
several times driven into Luxon's house by the
frequent showers that came over.  I no sooner
entered, than the natives flocked after me, and in
a few minutes the hut would be crowded.  The
little boys and girls here shewed me the same
officious attention that I received in making my way
to the village, but expressed in a different manner.
As many as could approach would surround me
with their fans, keeping them going until the rain
ceased, and I was again enabled to resume my
work.  This was a kind of civility, peculiarly
agreeable, as the weather was oppressively warm;
but I could not fail to discover that my little
attendants were all candidates for my friendly notice
and bestowed their civility with the expectation of
some reward.  I had a few trifles about me, but
not enough to give to all, and felt at a loss in
what way I should make my presents, fearing that
the least favoured would be mortified and
displeased.  It seemed however to make no
difference.  It was all "motake"[<a id="chap01fn5text"></a><a href="#chap01fn5">5</a>] with them.  All
seemed satisfied.  On my return to the beach, I
found it thronged with men, women, and children.
All the beauty and fashion of Massachusetts' Bay
had assembled in honour of our arrival, decked out
in their finest tappas, and gayest colours.  The
females were dressed in the best style of their
island, with neat turbans of tappa-cloth, white, or
ornamented with colours, a white robe of the same
material thrown loosely over them, tastefully
knotted on one shoulder, concealing half the
bosom, and a wrapper round the waist that reached
below the knee.  They were arranged in groups
of a dozen each, singing merrily and clapping their
hands in time to the music of their voices.  A
little way from them the men were seated in the
same manner and similarly occupied.  The ladies,
to improve their charms, had used an abundant
quantity of cocoa-nut oil, which filled the air with
its nauseous perfumes for an hundred yards round.
Many of them had more highly anointed themselves
with yellow paint, which, with the cocoa-nut
oil, was running from them in streams.  Some
had decorated themselves with necklaces of a
golden yellow fruit which bears a strong resemblance
to a pine-apple, and emits a powerful offensive
smell.  At a distance, with their variegated
robes flying in the wind, their appearance was
altogether agreeable, and upon a near approach
the scene was animated beyond description.  The
dusk of evening was the signal for their dispersion,
when some went one way and some another.
On the second of October, I wandered back upon
the hills, and had all the boys with me that
followed me on the preceding day.
</p>

<p>
They renewed their frolic of carrying me, and
whenever I seated myself, came round me as
many as could approach, each with a green leaf
for a fan.  I entered unceremoniously a number
of the huts, where I almost always found one or
more men, in nearly every instance, extended on
their backs, their heads resting on a log laid along
on one side of the hut, and their heels on another,
about four feet from the first.  They would never
rise to receive me, but utter "motake," when I
was perceived by them, and make motions for me
to do as they did, offering me at the same time a
fan, one of which they were using almost
constantly.  In the course of my ramble, I met with a
little girl, twelve or fourteen years old, who was
very pretty, attended by a servant, the only
instance in which I remarked such a thing on the
island.  She was evidently walking out to make a
visit, and had just arrived at the house of her
destination when I met her.  I put some beads
round her neck, which seemed to delight her very
much; but an old man present, whose hut she was
about to visit, assumed an angry look, and seemed
to threaten by his manner.  He changed his
conduct, however, when I made him a trifling present,
and the little girl, taking my hand, led me to her
father's hut.  He was a chief of some consequence,
as was indicated by the possession of two
or three casks of powder, and six muskets.  These
he took down, and displayed very ostentatiously,
and wanted to know if I had not others to dispose
of.  His conduct was altogether kind and hospitable,
in acknowledgment for which I made him a
present at my departure.  Whenever I wanted
cocoa-nuts to quench my thirst, I had only to
signify it to one of the men that was following me
about, and he would supply me from the nearest
tree.  With one fellow I was very much amused.
He carried his arms full of cocoa-nuts following
me about nearly all day, and when I returned to
the vessel I presented him with a musket ball,
with which he was perfectly satisfied, said it was
"motake," and went away.  When I returned to
the beach in the evening, I found the natives, male
and female, assembled in as great numbers as on
the day previous, and amusing themselves in the
same way.  The females were again in their
finest attire, and at a distance might any where
else have been mistaken for an assemblage of
fashionable belles.  We were apprehensive that
our men, a number of whom were at work on
shore, would have been very much annoyed by the
intrusion of the natives.  This, however, was not
the case.  When they commenced their work in
the morning a circle was made, comprehending
the whole space we wished them to occupy, which
we told the natives was tabooed, and there was
not an instance of their passing it.  The next day
they held quite a fair on the beach.  Amongst
other things, they had for trade large quantities of
cocoa-nuts and bread-fruit.  The former they
exchanged for small pieces of tobacco; but a piece
of iron hoop, fashioned into a tool or instrument
of husbandry, was demanded for the latter.  They
were all day on the beach, cooking and eating
their bread-fruit and cocoa-nuts.  In the
evening, the boys and men amused us with playing
soldiers, by ranging themselves in a line with
sticks for muskets.  One of our officers took a
particular pleasure in making grimaces, and talking
a gibberish to the natives in imitation of their
manner of speaking.  It was very offensive to
them; but they respected us too much to betray
their displeasure.  Upon one occasion, however,
he amused himself in this way with the boys, about
a hundred of whom were assembled, when I
encouraged them to retaliate on him, by clucking
like a hen.  They soon discovered that it was
disagreeable to him, and assembled round him
like so many little furies, clucking with all their
might.  It seemed to delight them to have an
opportunity of revenging themselves upon him,
which they did most amply, for they did not let
him rest a moment until he went on board, which
was soon afterwards, highly displeased with me
for conspiring with the Indians against him.  We
were often amused with the strange and ridiculous
taste of the natives in the article of dress.
</p>

<p>
They were all desirous of obtaining clothes,
and a number of old garments were given them,
or exchanged for curiosities by the officers and
crew.  When obtained, whether they fitted or
not, the Indians immediately put them on, and
scarcely ever more than one garment at a time.
Thus, half naked and half attired, a native would
walk about with exceeding gravity, admiring himself,
and believing that every one else was equally
pleased with his genteel appearance.
</p>

<p>
Whenever they seated themselves to sing, a
person was selected to occupy a conspicuous station,
and perform a dance round the circle, slowly,
and in the most graceful native style, striking at
the same time the hollow of his left arm with his
right hand, in time with the music of their voices.
This distinction was always conferred upon some
one who had obtained an old jacket or tattered
shirt.  If he had on a jacket, it was sure to be
buttoned closely round him, with the two or three
remaining buttons, and the sleeves, if not torn off,
would probably not reach more than half the length
of his arms.  Thus attired, he would perform his
evolutions round the circle slowly, and with a most
serious air, stopping occasionally to receive the
applause of the singers, who bestowed it upon
him with great enthusiasm.  Soon after daylight,
one morning I was on the beach, and my curiosity
led me to a place, where a number of females
were busily employed in collecting something from
the rocks.  When I approached them they
discontinued their occupation, and would have fled,
but I called them back, and prevailed upon them
to renew their occupation.  Each of them was
provided with a green leaf, in which she was
gathering from the rocks a species of fine green sea
moss and small snails.  What they preserved in
the leaf was intended for their families at home.
They ate freely of them, and said it was "motake."  The
moss was tender, but to me had no other taste
than that of salt water, with which it was covered
at high tide.  The snails were not larger than a
pea, covered with a hard shell, and when broken,
heated the tongue like pepper.  The moss, when
gathered, had a most disgusting appearance.  I
was told by the Englishmen, residing here, that
the natives esteem it a very great delicacy.  One
of the females had an infant with her a few months
old, which she was teaching to swim by holding it
in a pool of water, and occasionally letting it go.
The infant would make a slight effort, when let go
by the mother, and, no doubt, was taught to swim
almost as soon as it could walk.  On the third of
October, in walking through the habitable part of
the valley, I was every where met by females,
who addressed me with a smile, and finely
modulated tone of voice, "Coare ta whyhene?"[<a id="chap01fn6text"></a><a href="#chap01fn6">6</a>]  The
father of one of these, good naturedly conducted
me to the hut of a chief, highest in blood of any in
the valley.  He was a man upwards of fifty, and
apparently more civilized than any of the natives
I had seen before.  He told the interpreter to say,
that he felt pleasure in seeing me at his hut.  It
was about forty by twenty feet, and constructed
in the same way as that occupied by the Happah
chief, differing in no respect from those of the
common people, except in dimensions.  His rank
and importance was displayed in the possession
of six muskets, and two casks of powder that
hung directly fronting the door, and which the
chief took occasion to point out to me soon after
I entered.  To him they were a treasure, and, in
fact, the wealth and consequence of every individual
seemed to be estimated by this standard alone.
The powder was covered over with canvass, and
the muskets highly polished.  On one side of the
hut were two logs, about three feet apart, and
between them a coarse mat, for the convenience
of laying down on, one log being intended for the
head, and the other for the feet.  Whilst I was
here, a number of visitors came in, and, walking
directly to the logs, without noticing any one,
threw themselves down between them, their heads
on one, and feet on the other, where they lay,
fanning themselves, and looking at us, without
saying a word, except once or twice, when they
saw me looking at them, I was saluted with
"motake."  In the middle of the hut was the coffin of
the chief's father, who had died about six months
previous.  It was the trunk of a large bread-fruit
tree, six or eight feet long, highly polished, and
the lid so ingeniously fitted, that the place of
contact could not be seen but by the closest
examination.  He told me that his father had been a great
warrior, and the friend of Opotee.[<a id="chap01fn7text"></a><a href="#chap01fn7">7</a>]  Before his
door was a swivel, and a number of shot, that he
said he had obtained from Opotee.  He prized them
very highly, although they could not be of the
least use to him, except as they served to gratify
his vanity.  When I expressed a desire to know
the manner in which they prepared the paint,
used by the females, he directed his son to get
some of the root, and grind it between two stones,
mixing a little water with it, the only process
required.  I gave the chief's wife (who was an
old woman) some beads, and a cotton handkerchief,
with which she was so delighted, that she
threw both her arms around my neck, and
embraced me most affectionately.  She was painted
all over, quite yellow, and so thoroughly smeared
my clothes, that I paid dearly for this expression
of her regard.  At parting, the chief presented
me with a hog (the only one we obtained at the
Marquesas), some sticks of the tappa tree, and
offered whatever was acceptable to me, about his
house.  We also exchanged names, and I
promised again to visit him, but had no opportunity
afterwards.  His son accompanied me on board,
carrying the presents his father had made me,
and all the way calling me "Kappe," the name
of his father, and himself, by my name.
</p>

<p>
In the evening, when I returned to the vessel,
she was crowded with natives, the work of the day
being completed.  The men and women were in
different circles, singing their songs.  That of the
women, resembled the croaking of a great many
frogs.  The quick and lively motion of their
hands, accompanying the various modulations of
the voice, exhibited a great activity, and command
of muscle, and was far more pleasing than their
music.  There was one amongst the females, who
possessed great powers of voice, in the utterance
of strange sounds, in which none of the rest could
accompany her.  The performance seemed to
distress her very much, and was certainly very
disagreeable; yet the natives would all stop
occasionally, to listen to her, and, when she was done,
exclaimed, with seeming surprise, "motake!"
</p>

<p>
On the 4th of October, I took a boat, prepared
with arms, and providing myself with a few
presents, ran down for Lewis' Bay, to ascertain the
depth of water at the entrance of the harbour,
what difficulties might probably attend our
running in with the schooner, and whether it afforded
any better prospect than the other places we
had visited, of obtaining a supply of hogs.  The
distance was only six miles, and, with a fine breeze,
we were at the entrance of the harbour in little
more than an hour.  It was very narrow, formed
by two high points of land, and the depth of water
abundantly sufficient for ships of the largest class.
A heavy and broken swell made the entrance
appear difficult: and, without a fair wind, it is so
confined, that it would be hazardous to attempt it;
but the gorge being once passed, you enter a
large smooth basin, where there is scarcely a
ripple, the land rising high all around it, and the
points locking with each other.  In the basin we
found good anchorage, in from four to nine
fathoms water, and a clay bottom.  Lewis' Bay is
divided into two parts by a projecting point of
rocks.  I first landed in that which fronts the
entrance, or rather went into the edge of the surf.
A great many people, of all ages, came swimming
off through the surf, and in a few moments the
boat was full of them, and of fruit of various
kinds.  They were anxious for me to land, but I
saw there would be great difficulty in my getting
off again, in the event of any misunderstanding
with them, which was not altogether impossible.
I did not remain long, but, dismissing the natives
who had crawled into the boat, or were hanging
on the gunwale, pulled round the point of rocks to
the other landing.  When first I went into this
part of the harbour, I could perceive only two or
three persons, who were afraid to come near us.
They gradually relaxed in their timidity, however,
and kept nearing us a little, until we at last
prevailed upon them to get into the boat.  As soon
as they saw our muskets, which they thought
were intended for trade; but which were only for
our protection, they ran away, saying, they would
bring us hogs directly.  In the mean time the
news of our arrival spread, far and wide, over the
valley, and the people came running from every
direction, with whatever they could most readily
possess themselves of, for trade.  Every body
wanted muskets, and a chief had seven or eight
hogs brought to the beach, all of which he offered
for one gun.  After spending an hour or two here,
on the most friendly terms with the natives, I
prepared to depart, and missed one of my shoes,
that I had thrown off wet.  Search was made in
the boat, without finding it, when it was remarked,
that a native had been seen crawling in the water
for a considerable distance to a rock near the
shore, where he deposited something, and returned.
Upon examination, we found the shoe wrapped
up in a piece of tappa cloth, the Indian having
stolen it, without reflecting that the possession of
one shoe, without the other, was of no value to
him, or perhaps not caring whether it was or not,
so that he gratified his propensity to steal.  When
I returned a short distance, and held the shoe up
to show the natives that I had recovered it, they
set up a loud laugh, which I interpreted into
applause, of the ingenious exploit of their
countryman.  The valley of Lewis' Bay is not to be
compared to either of the other places we visited
on the island, for beauty or fertility.  It is,
however, quite populous, and the scenery is grand
and picturesque.  The land gradually rises from
a small plain below, like the valley occupied by
the Typees, in a succession of hills, and terminates
in a perpendicular high ledge of rocks.  In
returning from Lewis' to Massachusetts' Bay, the
wind was ahead, and we pulled close in with the
shore, which, for nearly the whole distance, rises
abruptly, from the ocean, to the height of six or
seven hundred feet.  Numerous falls, which were
only perceptible in heavy mist, before they reached
the water, were leaping from the top, whilst the sea
beat the sides with unceasing fury, throwing its
spray to the height of more than a hundred feet.
Whilst we were tugging at our oars, contemplating
this magnificent scene, the sea suddenly became
unusually agitated, and threatened, at every
instant, to swallow up the boat.  We pulled
directly from the shore, and for half an hour our
situation was very critical, after which the sea
became regular.  A phenomenon, so remarkable,
baffled all our speculation, and we were entirely
at a loss to determine respecting its cause.  On
our arrival on board, we learned that the vessel
had narrowly escaped being driven on shore in a
squall It was not the fault of the anchorage, but
in consequence of the baffling winds which had
several times driven the vessel over her anchor,
whereby it was fouled by the cable, and tripped
with the violence of the squall.
</p>

<p>
The natives, as usual, were assembled on the
shore near us, amusing themselves in their
customary way, by singing and dancing.  The
females, having learned from some of the Dolphin's
crew, that it was not in good taste to use cocoa-nut
oil, and paint, in such profusion, left it off, as
well as the golden yellow fruit, which had also
been highly disapproved of.  It improved their
appearance, and they seemed to be sensible of
the superior estimation in which they were held.
These wild ladies, in truth, who, on our first
arrival, came swimming round, like so many
mermaids, grew very fastidious in the short time we
remained at their island.  After the first day or
two, they requested to be allowed to go on board,
in our boats, and then, seeing some of the officers
carried through the surf by the seamen, nothing
less would please them, when they did us the
honour of a visit, but to be gallanted on board with
the same ceremony.  Our sailors gallantly
condescended to gratify two or three of them; but,
instead of taking them to the boat, they most
uncourteously let them fall into the first heavy roller
they encountered, leaving them to the choice
of swimming to the boat, or back to the shore
again, after which none ever asked to be carried.
With regard to their superstitions or worship, we
could learn but little.  John Luxon told me, that
he was tabooed by his father, who was a chief, and
that no common man dared to pass over his head.
He was usually dressed in a sailor's shirt and
trowsers, and an old hat.  He came off regularly
every morning, and ate with us three time a day,
taking his seat at the table, without the least
ceremony, and never waiting to be asked.
</p>

<p>
One day, some one had, designedly or accidentally,
thrown some bread in John's hat, which he
did not perceive when he took it up, and put
it on.  When he felt the bread upon his head,
he threw his hat off instantly, and, with a look of
the utmost horror, exclaimed, "who put dat dare?
Me Taboo here!" (putting his hand on his head)
"To-morrow me sick, me die!"  This, he
repeated over a number of times, and with great
earnestness of manner tried to find out who had
put the bread in his hat, insisting upon it, that, on
the morrow, he should sicken and die.  The
morrow, however, came, and John was alive and well,
and was heartily laughed at for his foolish
superstition, when he came on board as usual to spend
the day with us.  I do not believe that John had
the same implicit faith in taboo afterwards.  I
tried to find out from him what was meant by his
being tabooed, but he spoke English so badly,
and seemed to understand so little of the matter
himself, that I was not much the wiser for his
explanation.  We were told here, that, a few
years since, the missionaries at the Society Islands,
moved by the benevolent purpose of converting
the Marquesas islanders to Christianity, sent one
of their number to reside at Massachusetts' Bay.
The missionary landed amongst his charge, by
whom he was received with characteristic kindness
and hospitality.  No other notice was taken
of him, however, than would have been bestowed
upon the most poor and ignorant mariner, seeking
an asylum amongst them.  He was permitted to
fix upon his place of residence, and live in such
way as pleased him best.  He soon commenced
preaching the doctrines of his faith.  The natives
listened to him, wondering at all he said, but not
less at his singular manner of life,&mdash;to them
unexampled, in all their acquaintance with the
whites,&mdash;and, certainly, unparalleled amongst
themselves.  They had always seen the white
men, who visited their islands, take liberties with
their females, and mingle with them in all their
pleasures, whilst this man, who called himself a
messenger from the Great Spirit, lived a life of
celibacy, retired from all that, to them, was
amusing or agreeable.  When a free interchange of
opinion had taken place amongst them, respecting
him, they came to the conclusion, that he was
differently made and constituted from all other men
they had ever seen, and curiosity being raised to
the highest pitch, they, with a levity peculiar to
savages, determined to subject him to a scrutiny.
The missionary, alarmed at a disposition that
evinced so little respect for his character and
personal rights, took his departure by the first
opportunity, since which no attempt has been made
to convert the natives of the Marquesas to Christianity.
</p>

<p>
The men of the Marquesas, were, in general,
quite naked.  But few ornaments were worn by
either sex.  The women frequently had no other
ornament than a small flower, stuck through a slit
in their ears.  Some of the men wore polished
whale's teeth round their necks, and some shell
bracelets, but they were not in common use.  A
few were tattooed all over, and others but
slightly.  The mode of their tattooing seemed
to be altogether a matter of fancy.  Some had
indulged the most whimsical taste, in having
indelibly pricked into their flesh, fish, birds, and
beasts, of all kinds known to them.  Others
were tattooed black, even to the inner part of
their lips.  It is an art in high estimation amongst
them.  There are men, who pursue it as a regular
business, and are in great favour with their
countrymen, for their skilful performance.  The
women tattoo more tastefully than the men.  Their
feet and legs, half-way to the knee, are usually
covered with figures, wrought with great neatness,
and the right hand and arm, half-way to the
elbow, is often similarly ornamented.  Both men
and women commonly wear their hair short, and
when instances to the contrary are met with, the
persons invariably have a disgusting appearance,
their hair hanging in long and disagreeable
looking matted locks.
</p>

<p>
The men are finely formed, large, and active;
and both men and women would, in many
instances, be considered handsome, were it not for
our fastidious objection to their copper colour.
Their teeth are very beautiful, and formed a
subject of remark to us all, while we were amongst
them.  I do not think that, of all the people that
came under my observation at Nooaheeva, there
was a single one with bad teeth.  This is the
more remarkable in the men, as they are
accustomed all their lives to strip the husk of the
cocoa-nut in the manner I have described.
</p>

<p>
A plurality of wives is not admitted amongst
them under any circumstances.  The sexes rarely
live together, as man and wife, until they have
arrived at the middle age of life.  When a man
wishes to take a wife, he first obtains the consent
of the female, who solicits that of her friends,
which, being obtained, the girl's father kills a
hog, or, if a chief, a number of hogs, and makes
a feast, to which all the friends of both parties
are invited.  After this ceremonial is performed,
which is an occasion of great merriment, the
parents of the girl furnish her with a few pieces of
tappa cloth, and she is conducted by her husband
to his house.  The females, although invited to
these feasts, are not permitted to partake of the
hogs, roasted for the occasion.  They are
tabooed for the men alone.  Hogs are scarcely ever
used by the natives, but upon the occasion of a
death or marriage.  When a chief, or other
person dies, possessing many hogs, a great feast is
made.  The only arms, that are now generally
used, are muskets.  Most of the natives, who have
any property, own one or more.  I did not see
a single war club at Nooaheeva, and but few
spears.  I met several persons, who had the scars
of musket balls, that they told me were received
in battle.  Each of the renegade Englishmen was
living with a chief, who thought there was scarcely
any thing that he could not perform.  Besides
supporting them, they gave them all the consequence
of chiefs in their intercourse with the natives,
so far as their own authority would admit of
it.  They were highly respected by the natives,
and even John Luxon boasted to me of his
superiority over the other Indians, in speaking
English.  I asked John, of what advantage his
speaking English was to him, to which he replied, that
it enabled him to cheat his countrymen.
</p>

<p>
The whole face of the island of Nooaheeva is
high and mountainous.  Every part I visited is
composed of volcanic cinders, and evidently owes
its origin to some great convulsion of nature.
Whilst we remained at Massachusetts' Bay, the
weather was mild and pleasant.  We had several
heavy showers, which, in one instance, only was
accompanied with a squall of wind.  After these
showers it was delightful to contemplate the beauty
of the innumerable little cascades of water every
where falling over the rocks from the tops of the
mountains.  In a few hours, many of them would
become less brilliant, and some would quite
disappear.  We found the longitude of our anchorage
by the mean of three chronometers, to be one
hundred and thirty-nine degrees fifty-four minutes
and thirty seconds west; latitude, by a series of
observations, eight degrees fifty-seven minutes
forty-five seconds south.
</p>

<p>
October the 5th, we got under way, and stood
out with a light and baffling wind, tacking very
close in with both shores.  At nine, A.M., we passed
the Sentinels, and bore up to the westward with a
moderate breeze from E.S.E.  The islands
Rooahooga and Rooapooa, were plainly in sight.  In
clear weather they may be seen at least fifty
miles.  The amiable character of the inhabitants
of Nooaheeva, and the friendly disposition they
had evinced towards us upon all occasions, made
us feel regret at leaving them so soon.  The
course that now lay before us, carried us away
from all the civilized world; and the islands in
our way affording but little to tempt navigators to
visit them, were known to us only as places,
existing on the wide surface of the ocean, where,
with few exceptions, the inhabitants had never
seen the face of a white man.  We could anticipate
no other gratification from our contemplated
visit to them, than the indulgence of our curiosity.
The weather became squally after our departure
from the Marquesas, and continued so for several
days, during which time we were frequently
deceived by the clouds assuming the strongest
appearance of land, for which we steered two or
three times, under a full conviction that we had
made a discovery.  We could picture to
ourselves, the mountains, and valleys, and bays, and,
to confirm the deception, we frequently saw land
birds flying about us.
</p>

<p>
At day-light, on the 10th of October, we
discovered Caroline Island, bearing W.S.W., and
distant fourteen miles.  We were on the weather
side of it, and a furious surf was every where in
sight, breaking upon a reef some distance from
the shore.  We stood along to the westward, and
at nine, A.M., passed a reef, that makes out from
the N.W. end of the island, protecting it to the
S.W. from the heavy easterly swell, and prevailing
winds.  Under the lee of the reef, we stood
in, with the hope of finding anchorage, getting
frequent casts of the lead, until, to our great
disappointment, it was discovered that there was
deep sea-water within a few feet of a bed of coral,
that stretched off three or four hundred yards
from the shore, farther to the south and west, a
high surf was breaking, and this being the only
place where we could land, and, desirous of
exploring the island, we took a small kedge to the
coral bank, by which we rode to the easterly trade
winds.  Here we landed without much difficulty,
and made our way to the shore, over the coral,
although it was full of holes, and looked as though
it would give way under our feet.  The holes in
the coral-bed were from one to three feet deep,
and some of them had the appearance of communicating
with the ocean.  In these holes, we found
an abundance of large and very fine fish, with
which we supplied the crew in great plenty.  They
were of several different kinds, the best of which
were the red grouper, and a long fish, of a dark
colour, for which we had no name.  Boarding
pikes and boat-hooks were the only instruments
we used for taking them, and by this simple
apparatus alone a frigate's crew might have been
supplied in a short time.  A boat was also sent
to fish alongside of the coral bank, where were
myriads of red grouper, of a large size; but the
sharks were so numerous, that, for every fish, we
lost two or three hooks.
</p>

<p>
The tide rises, at Caroline Island, from three to
four feet, and, at low water, the coral-bank was
nearly dry.  This was the case when we landed,
and, having remained there several hours, our
fishing party was surprised with a rise of the
water, that made it difficult, and somewhat
dangerous for them to retrace their steps to the edge
of the bank, the holes in many places not being
perceptible, and the water in them over their
heads.  What made their situation the more
disagreeable was the number of sharks that had
come in with the tide, and which occasionally
made a bite at their feet or legs.  One man, who
had a large bunch of fish which he trailed through
the water, was so closely pursued, and fiercely
attacked by them, that he was compelled to take
refuge upon a rock that lay in his way, from
which he could not again be prevailed upon to
descend, until the boat went to his relief.  Caroline
Island is uninhabited.  It is from five to eight
miles long, and no where in the vicinity of our
anchorage more than from a quarter to half a
mile wide.  There are some trees of a large size
upon it, and in most places a thick growth of
underwood.  It is every where bounded by a bed of
coral, which generally extends several hundred
yards from the shore.  We saw no animals on it,
and no other reptiles than small lizards.  Sea
birds were tolerably numerous, and a few sand
snipe were seen.  On the weather side of the
island, we found a cocoa-nut tree, that, to all
appearance, had but recently drifted on shore.
Besides the cocoa-nut tree, we found two articles
of Indian furniture.  That they came from an
inhabited island, there can be no doubt, and it is
equally certain that the island has never been
discovered, as there is none laid down upon the
chart, in the direction of the trade winds, from
Caroline Island, nearer than the Society Islands.
The Marquesas are the nearest to Caroline, of
any land known; and they are distant upwards
of six hundred miles, and differ in their bearing a
little from the general direction of the trade
winds.  On the cocoa-nut tree there were two
nuts, which had the appearance of having been
but a short time in the water.  We planted them
near our anchorage.  Caroline Island is low, and
every where flat, with the exception of a few sand
hillocks, that rise a little above the ordinary level.
It is no where more than four or five feet above
the sea.  We obtained a boat-load of pepper-grass
and pursely, of which there was a great
abundance; and on the 13th, at meridian,
unhooked our kedge, and made sail to the westward.
Our place of landing at Caroline Island, was south
latitude nine degrees fifty-four minutes thirty
seconds; west longitude, one hundred and fifty
degrees eighteen seconds.
</p>

<p>
Previous to taking our departure from the coast
of Peru, the commander of the station had furnished
us with a long list of islands, said to have
been recently discovered by whalers, and we
were now in the vicinity of two of them, one of
which was laid down in south latitude eight
degrees forty minutes; and west longitude one
hundred and fifty-nine degrees fifty minutes.  The
other, in south latitude, six degrees forty-two
minutes; went longitude one hundred and sixty-six
degrees ten minutes.  After our departure
from Caroline Island, we steered for the supposed
new discovery, that was nearest to us, being that
in latitude eight degrees forty seconds; and,
having cruised two days in the vicinity, bore away,
under a full conviction that it did not exist, or had
been laid down incorrectly.  In our search for
the other island, we were equally unsuccessful;
and after running down a degree or two of longitude,
in its parallel of latitude, continued on to
the southward and westward, shaping our course
for the Duke of Clarence Island.  Whilst we were
looking for these new discoveries, we were
frequently deceived by the same false appearance of
land, that I have noticed soon after our departure
from the Marquesas, and several times we saw
land-birds[<a id="chap01fn8text"></a><a href="#chap01fn8">8</a>] flying about the vessel.
</p>

<p>
At four, A.M., on the 29th of October, we discovered
the Duke of Clarence Island ahead, twelve
miles from us.  At day-light, the N.W. end was
full in sight, and on each side of it, apparently at
a great distance, the tops of the trees could but
just be seen through the haze of the morning,
looking as though they rose from the ocean.  As
we approached nearer, a great many islets rose
to view, connected with each other by a chain of
coral reefs.  In sailing round them, we discovered
that they formed a polygon, the sides of which
were narrow strips of land and coral reefs,
comprehending within them a lake of many miles in
circumference.  When we first got close in with
the island, this lake, intervening between us and
the most distant islets that rose at the utmost limit
of our vision, almost persuaded us, for a time,
that it was an extensive group, instead of one
little island that looked like a speck upon the
general chart.  The lake was everywhere
protected against the ocean, and so smooth, that not
an undulation could be seen upon its surface.
The wind was light, the sea smooth,&mdash;the air had
the mildness and elasticity of a spring morning;
and these deep green spots, upon the wide waste
of ocean, were truly beautiful.  The islets were
low, rising but a few feet above the water, and all
covered with a thick growth of cocoa-nut trees.
When we run down within a few miles of the
shore to the westward, where, near the beach,
were a few huts, two canoes put off, and pulled for
us with great rapidity, and shortly afterwards not
less than twenty were in sight.
</p>

<p>
All this part of the shore was bounded by a
coral reef, upon which was breaking a heavy
surf, and as we wished to anchor, and look for
water, we continued on for the leeward shore.
We were under easy sail, and the canoes kept
way with us, constantly increasing in number,
having, each of them, from four to seven men.
One of them came very near us, and to save
the natives the labour of working at their paddles,
we threw them the end of a rope.  They laid
hold of it very eagerly, but instead of tying it to
some part of their canoe, as we expected they
would have done, they hauled up by it as close to
our stern as they could get, and made motions
for us to give them more.  We did so, and they
again motioned us to veer to.  This, we thought
unnecessary, as they had already sufficient for
the purpose we intended.  When they found that
their solicitations for more were not heeded, they
very deliberately took a sharp instrument of bone
or shell, and cut the rope off, having several
fathoms in their canoe.  As soon as they had
done this, they took to their paddles, and pulled
away for us with all their might, and were soon
again near enough to have a rope thrown to them,
which they called for as loud as they could,
making, at the same time, significant motions.  When
they found that we would not give them the rope
again, they paddled up to our quarter, and one of
them, who was a powerful man, came on board,
without seeming to fear us in the least.  Several
of the officers spoke to him, and tried to call his
attention; but, without taking the least notice of
any body, he walked straight to the stern-netting,
where he commenced most industriously to throw
into his canoe every thing that he could lay hands
on.  The quarter-master and others, who were
near, remonstrated with him, in vain, against such
outrageous conduct.  Their interference seemed
only to excite his indignation, and make him the
more active in accomplishing his design.  When
we found that nothing else would prevail with
him, I took a musket that lay near me, and gave
him a slight blow with it, calling at the same time
on some of the men, who stood near, to lay hold
of him.  He seized the musket, when I struck
him, and would have taken me overboard with
it, but for the timely assistance of those who were
near.  He made his escape before the men could
get hold of him, having succeeded in throwing
into his canoe the log-reel and line, besides a
number of other articles, that we could not
conveniently spare.  We would have pursued the
canoe, and taken from it the stolen articles, but
they all moved with such rapidity, that we had
no hope of overtaking them, if we made the
attempt.  When the natives in the other canoes
had witnessed the success of their comrades in
carrying off their booty, which they were displaying
to those around them, with great delight, they
were encouraged to come near, and make a
similar attempt at plunder.  They were somewhat
cautious, however, having witnessed the resistance
we made.  The next theft was that of breaking
off one of the rudder-irons of the waist-boat.  The
captain, who was near, prevailed upon the fellow
to give it up, which he did, without the least
hesitation; but, remaining quietly where he was, he
seized the opportunity, when the captain's face
was turned from him, and, snatching the piece of
iron out of his hands, jumped overboard, and swam
to the nearest canoe.  We were all the time close
in with the shore, getting frequent casts of the
deep sea lead, and the moment it was overboard,
and the line was seen by the natives, they made
for it in a dozen canoes, and with instruments
of sharp shells, fastened to sticks, endeavoured
to cut it off.  They paid not the slightest
attention to our remonstrances and threats, and the
only way in which we could prevent them from
effecting their object, was by hauling the line in
as fast as possible.
</p>

<p>
After running along the shore for several miles,
seeking in vain for anchorage, we began to
examine the reefs, that connected the islets, with
great solicitude, in the hope of finding an opening
into the lake, whore we should be protected from
the wind and sea.  Of this, however, we soon
despaired, and passing the south-west point of the
island, a bountiful little bay opened to our view,
upon the shore of which the surf beat less
violently than we had seen it elsewhere.  Here we
hove to, and sent a boat in shore to look for
anchorage.  She soon returned with a report that,
within less than half a cable's length of the shore,
no bottom could be found, with upwards of a
hundred fathoms of line.  We now gave up all
intention of anchoring, and permitted the natives to
come alongside, and exchange whatever we had,
that was mutually acceptable to each other.  They
had continued to follow us, and, growing bold
with their numbers, frequently threw on board of
the vessel clubs, cocoa-nuts, or whatever they had
in their canoes, that could be used as missiles.
This was accompanied by such a loud shouting,
and they had become so numerous, that the orders
for the ordinary duty of the vessel could not be
heard.  Some of their clubs were so large, as to
be capable of inflicting a fatal blow by the
violence with which they were thrown, and our
apprehensions of suffering some evil consequence
from this licentious conduct of our new
acquaintances, were soon realised, by one of them
striking the surgeon upon the head.  He was in ill
health, and had just come upon deck to witness
the novel spectacle around us, when the unwelcome
salutation was given.  It alarmed us at first
for his safety; but, to our gratification, we
discovered that his hat had so far protected his head,
that the wound was not severe.  As soon as the
natives saw the schooner heave to, they closed
around us, and as many as could get alongside,
came with whatever they had to offer.  Nearly a
hundred canoes were assembled, and in them
several hundred men.  When they saw us hoisting
out our boat for the purpose of sounding, they
became alarmed, and took to flight.  No inducement
could prevail upon them to come near us,
whilst the boat lay alongside, and as soon as she
shoved off, they took to their paddles, and
retreated as fast as they could; but when they saw
that she took a different direction, and it was not
her object to pursue them, they all turned and
followed her.  They gathered around her at a
short distance, apparently afraid to approach
nearer, at first making signs for her to go on
shore, where was a numerous group of men,
women, and children, inviting our people to land.
Seeing that the boat would not go on shore, and
after the duty assigned had been accomplished,
that she was returning to the schooner, the natives
with one accord closed more nearly around her,
as if to intercept her passage.  The officer in the
boat made threats and signs for them to retire, to
which they paid not the slightest attention.  A
canoe came on each side of the boat, and the
natives laid hold of the oars, a man rising in each
canoe at the same time, with a barbed spear,
which he held in the attitude of throwing.  The
officer, feeling that his situation was a very
critical one, and thinking that the report of his pocket
pistol would cause them to desist, presented it
with a design to fire ahead of one of the canoes.
It did not go off, but the snap was a signal
sufficient for our men to prepare for their defence,
believing they were exposed to the greatest danger.
They seized their pistols, with one of which
each man was provided, and before the officer
could interfere to prevent them from firing (the
noise and confusion amongst the natives being
such, that he could not be heard) one of the men
discharged his piece, and the ball passed through
the hand of one of the natives.  They became
alarmed at the extraordinary report of the pistol,
and immediately after it, seeing the blood flow
from the hand of their countryman, discontinued
their assault, and retired with precipitation.  The
boat then returned to the schooner unmolested,
the natives flying from her in every direction as
she approached them.  We were apprehensive
that the report of the pistol, and the wounding one
of the natives would produce so great a panic
amongst them, as to interrupt our farther
intercourse.  But in this we were agreeably
disappointed, for the boat was no sooner hoisted in,
than they came alongside, with as much
confidence, as though nothing of the kind had
occurred.  In an hour afterwards, the wounded man
was seen in a canoe, fifty or a hundred yards
from us, apparently afraid to come nearer.  He
was distinguished by having his hand bound up in
green leaves.  After making motions to him, and
those around us, and holding up a variety of
things for his acceptance, he was at last prevailed
upon to come near us.  When he saw the sentinel,
in the gangway, he stopped, and we in vain held
up our presents for him, until the sentinel was
removed.  He then came on board, and suffered
his wound to be examined and dressed, trembling
and staring around him, like one in the greatest
terror.  We were gratified to find that the wound
was not so severe as was to have been apprehended,
the ball having passed through the fleshy
part of his hand, between the thumb and forefinger,
without breaking any bones, and probably
without inflicting upon him a serious injury.  When
his wound was dressed, and he received a few
presents of old iron, &amp;c., to him invaluable, he
left us, and jumped from one canoe to another,
with the activity of a monkey, holding up his
treasure, and talking with great vehemence,
apparently delighted with his good fortune.  The
natives had nothing to exchange with us but a few
mats, some of which were finely wrought, cocoa-nuts,
bone and shell ornaments, and fishing-hooks,
for which we gave them, in return, pieces of iron
hoops, or old nails.  We witnessed several
instances of dishonesty amongst them, as well as
their entire want of confidence in us.  Whenever
one of them presented any thing for exchange, he
held it firmly grasped in his hand, until he
received his pay with the other; and if he first
obtained the old nail or iron hoop, without the
person, with whom he was trading, getting firmly
hold of his mat or whatever it might be, he was
sure to keep both.  Every man carried a long
spear, and some of them a short weapon, slightly
curved like a sword.  Their spears were from
eight to twelve feet long, some of which had one
and some two branches near the end.  They
were pointed with the hard bone of a large fish,
and, from one to two feet from the point, covered
with rows of shark's teeth, that were immoveably
fixed by a neat moulding of twine passing through
the teeth, and round the spear.  The short
weapons were armed in the same manner all over,
except a small part left for the grasp of the hand.
Both were formidable weapons, and capable of
inflicting a mortal wound.  A few of them wore
dry wreaths of cocoa-nut leaves round their brows,
which were the only kind of covering we saw any
of them have about their heads, and as the
instances were rare, we thought it probable that
they were chiefs.  The dress for their loins
consisted of two pieces, one of which was composed
of a few plaited leaves, next to the skin, and the
other consisted of a mat, from two to three feet
wide, and four long, beautifully fringed at the
bottom, and which served, not only as a pretty
ornament, but was useful as a protection against
the flies, which almost everywhere amongst these
islands are very troublesome.  They were strong
and robust looking men, of a very dark copper
colour, and most of them, particularly the old men,
covered with scars, that they gave us to
understand were occasioned by wounds from their
spears and daggers.  They wore their hair long,
and in disagreeable looking matted locks.  None
of them had heavy beards, and in general but
little.  It is not improbable that they pull them
out with fish-scales, as is practised at the
Marquesas, and many others of the South Sea Islands.
This is done by compressing the beard with the
fingers between two large fish-scales, in the
manner of applying a pair of tweezers.  A great
many natives, most of them women and children,
had assembled on the shore, opposite to us, where
they remained all day, singing and amusing
themselves.  No females came off in the canoes.
</p>

<p>
We saw no water, except a small quantity that
one or two of the natives had in cocoa-nut shells,
and, much to our regret, from ignorance of their
language, could not inquire where it was to be
obtained.  The land no where rose more than
from three to seven feet above the level of the
sea, and as we could not land with safety, we had
no means of ascertaining whether any rivulets
existed upon it.  The island seemed to produce
nothing, but cocoa-nuts, which must be the only
food of the natives, except when they are so
fortunate as to catch fish.  Towards evening we
stood out of the bay, and hove to off the
south-west point, where we sent a party on shore to
collect a quantity of cocoa-nuts, of which there
was a dense forest, that promised an
abundant supply.  Our people were no sooner on
shore than they saw the natives approaching them
in different directions, armed with spears and
paddles, making signals to each other, and signs,
for the intruders to depart.  Every tree had some
peculiar mark, from whence we concluded, it was
considered the property of some individual.  It
was after sun-down, and night was closing in fast
upon our party, who finding, from the determined
manner of the natives, that, whatever they took,
must be by violence, gave up the enterprise, and
returned to the beach.  It was fortunate that they
did so, for the tide had risen considerably, and
with it the surf had increased in a dangerous
degree.  All, however, got off safe, but with wet
jackets, and at eight, P.M., October the 30th, we
hoisted in the boat, and made sail.
</p>

<p>
We ran off with a fine breeze, and at half-past
three, A.M., made the Duke of York's Island,
directly ahead, and sooner than we expected.  It was
not more than three or four miles off; the deep
hollow roar of the surf could be distinctly heard, and
its foaming white crest seen through the mists
of the night, as it tumbled on the shore.  We
hove to until morning, when we made sail along
the land, towards the south end of the island.
This island is noted on the chart, as uninhabited,
when discovered by Commodore Byron, in 1791;
and it may be supposed, that we were not a little
surprised, on approaching the southern point, to see
two canoes putting off for us.  One of them came
alongside, the other kept at a distance.  The
first had but one man in it, who exchanged a mat
for a piece of iron hoop, and returned immediately
to the shore, followed by his consort.  When we
got to the southward of the point, which was the
lee side of the island, we hove to, and sent a boat
to look for anchorage.  The shores were similar
to those of Caroline and Clarence Islands,&mdash;of
coral, and shelving suddenly into deep sea-water.
It was somewhat better here, however, for within
half a cable's length of the surf, we let go our
anchor in twenty fathoms water.  Although we
veered eighty fathoms of cable, the bottom was
so smooth, and its angle of depression so great,
that we drifted off.
</p>

<p>
We stood in again, and running the vessel close
in with the edge of the surf (the wind blowing off
shore) came to in eight fathoms.  In a few minutes,
a native made his appearance on the coral bank,
near us, with his arms full of cocoa-nuts, which he
held up, as if for our acceptance, waving at the
same time a green branch, and frequently jumping
about upon the rocks, in a childish, playful
manner.  A boat was sent to bring him off; but
when he saw her approaching pretty near, he
threw the nuts in the water towards her, and
hastily retired.  A coral bed, like that at Caroline
Island, extended off fifty or a hundred yards from
the shore, which, like that, was perforated every
where with holes, and resembled, in its frail
appearance, ice that has been for a long time
exposed to rain.  The tide was low, and the surf
breaking but lightly upon it, we were enabled to
land without difficulty.  At our approach the
natives all ran off, and for a considerable time could
not be prevailed upon to come near us.  After a
while their timidity relaxed, and they came round
us, one by one, until we had a dozen of them
assembled.  Still they were very much afraid,
starting with every motion we made, and if we
attempted to touch them, they ran from us, and
became as shy as ever.  From our place of landing,
we could discover that this island was similar
to the Duke of Clarence, being a narrow chain of
little islets and reefs, of coral formation, covered
with bushes and cocoa-nut trees, and comprehending
within the chain a lake of many miles in circumference.
</p>

<p>
At our place of landing, the island between the
ocean and inland sea, was not more than two
hundred yards wide, and this appeared to be as
wide as any part of the chain that came under
our immediate observation.  In passing over to
the borders of the lake, we saw near the centre
of it a large raft, and a number of canoes filled
with people.  On first landing, we were surprised
not to see any women or children, the mystery of
which was now explained, as well as the singular
visit we received on first approaching this part of
the island.  The person in the canoe had been
sent off as a spy, to reconnoitre us, and from the
report he made, it was thought expedient to
remove the women and children, where we now saw
them at a place of safety.  They did not appear
to be more than thirty in number, and the men on
the island did not exceed fifteen.  The men
resembled the inhabitants of Clarence Island, in
dress, colour, and every thing, except that they
had a sickly look, and, in strength and activity,
seemed much their inferiors.  Their canoes were
also the same.  Like the inhabitants of the Duke
of Clarence Island, they had nothing amongst
them that indicated a visit of white men before.
The cocoa-nut, except when they catch fish, is
their only food.  No bread-fruit trees were seen
growing upon either island.  They exchanged for
iron hoop and old nails, their rude shell
ornaments, mats, cocoa-nuts, and fishing nets.  We
witnessed several instances of dishonesty,
practised by them upon us, and each other.  Their
fishing-nets, which were beautifully wrought, they
had concealed, from the apprehension that we
would plunder them; but when they had made
acquaintance with us, and found that our disposition
towards them was friendly, persons, to whom
the nets did not belong, would purloin, and bring
them to us, in exchange for pieces of iron hoop.
Not long afterwards the owner would discover his
net in the possession of one of our people, and claim
it as his property, or demand a gratuity.  In this
way, they made us pay in some instances three or
four times for the same thing, frequently (we
began to suspect) pretending a fraud had been
committed upon them, whilst they themselves were
the rogues.  We saw no animals or birds upon
the island, but presented them with a pair of pigs,
male and female, with which they were very much
pleased, and before we left them, so far acquired
their confidence, that they came amongst us
without fear, and, in many instances, became
troublesome by their familiarity.  The only water we
saw on the island was in a few trunks of cocoa-nut
trees, the stumps of which had been hollowed
out, and from whence we supposed that, in time
of drought, if not always, they are supplied with
this important necessary of life.  We regretted
the more that we could not find a sufficient
supply here, as the thinly populated state of the
island would admit of sending our parties on shore,
without the least apprehension of hostility from
the natives, and because the landing was such, as
to permit the embarkation, without great labour,
or risk of losing boats.
</p>

<p>
As the Duke of York Island was not inhabited,
when discovered by Commodore Byron, thirty-five
years previous to the visit of the Dolphin, it is
reasonable to suppose, from the strong resemblance of
the natives to those of Clarence Island, their dress
and canoes being the same, that they came from
thence at no very distant period.  The distance of
these islands from each other, is only about forty
miles, and a canoe, being driven from one in the
direction of the other, in tempestuous weather,
would soon be in sight of it.  Towards evening
in returning on board, we found, to our regret,
that the tide had risen two or three feet over the
coral bank, and it became difficult for us to see
the holes, some of which, being now filled with
water, were deep enough to be attended with
danger.  Besides this, the surf, as is usual upon
these coral banks, had increased with the rising
tide to such a degree, that we found it difficult to
embark.  Guided by our observation, in the
morning, however, we got on board safely, with
the exception of some trifling accidents.  The
most serious of which was having the boat bilged
against the rocks.
</p>

<p>
At four, P.M. on the 31st of October, we got
under way, and steered to the westward.  For
several days the weather was squally, and the
wind variable, shifting suddenly to all points of
the compass, and blowing at times with great
violence.  We experienced strong currents setting
in different directions, which were now a cause of
serious alarm to us, as we should soon be surrounded
by reefs and chains of islands, all low, and to
be seen only for a few miles on a clear day.  On
the 9th of November, Byron's Island was seen, at
8 P.M. six miles from us, and soon afterwards the
shore was lighted up with a number of fires.  The
surf was beating heavily upon the weather-shore.
We stood off and on until morning, when, having
been driven to leeward by a strong current, we
beat up for the island, passing several canoes on
our way, and having a great many others in
different directions to windward, running down for
us.  At meridian, we were close in with the land,
where we beat about for several hours, looking for
anchorage.  Once we tacked, in three fathoms,
so close to the coral bank, where was beating a
heavy surf, that we could almost have jumped
upon it.  At 6, P.M. on the tenth, we anchored
in ten fathoms, within less than a cable's length
of the surf, and where the water was so clear,
that we could see almost every coral rock at the
bottom.  Besides the rocks, it presented the
appearance of a splendid landscape of trees and
copse-wood, ornamented with the most lively and
brilliant colours, which, affected by the swelling
of the ocean, were transformed into a representation
of a rich and beautiful country of mountain
and valley.
</p>

<p>
Whilst we were beating about, canoes were
assembling near us, in great numbers, and as soon
as we anchored, came along side, the people
jumping on board without the least hesitation,
talking and hallooing to each other so loud, as
almost to deafen us with their noise.  They had
not been long on board, before several of them
were detected in thieving, and when threatened,
seemed quite regardless of our displeasure,
although it was expressed in a way calculated to
make them sensible of its disagreeable consequences.
They were all provided with long shark's-tooth
spears, and walked about the deck with a
swaggering, independent air, that seemed to
challenge, at least, an equality.  But few brought
any thing else with them but their spears, which
they would not dispose of, and altogether, their
number and appearance was truly formidable.  At
sunset, we sent them off, and they all returned to
their respective islets.
</p>

<p>
The appearance of Byron's Island, differed
scarcely in any respect from that of the Duke of
Clarence.  Its dimensions and formation were perfectly
similar; and, like the latter, it was inhabited
by an enterprising and warlike people, whose
dress, arms, canoes, and manner of life, seemed to
be identically the same.  The islet abreast of us
was all night illuminated with numerous fires, and
the air rung incessantly with the shouts of
hundreds of people.
</p>

<p>
When the day dawned, the whole ocean was
whitened with the little sails of canoes that were
seen coming from every direction, and some of
them as far as the eye could distinguish so small
an object.  In an hour, not less than a hundred
of them were alongside, and our deck was crowded
with the natives.  The officer of the watch
undertook to wash off the deck, which he found
altogether impracticable: not a word could be
understood for the noise that they made, and when
they were pushed out of the way by our people,
they became insolent and resentful.  We were at
length, obliged to resort to some little violence to
clear the decks of the unruly rabble, whose
disposition to thievery and violence, became every
moment more difficult to repress.
</p>

<p>
An old athletic chief, whom our captain had
treated with more than ordinary attention, suddenly
put his arms round him, and embraced him with
such herculean strength, that he was constrained
to call on the men near him for assistance; in a
moment, they had a rope around the old chief's
neck, and broke his grasp, and the captain having
enough of Indian courtesy, was well pleased to
dismiss them.  They still remained near us, and as
many as were allowed, came alongside.  They
exchanged for pieces of old iron, coarse matting,
flying-fish, shell ornaments, and a few of them
disposed of their spears.
</p>

<p>
One fellow, who evinced an obstinate determination
to come alongside, was ordered off by the
sentinel, who pointed his musket at him.  As
soon as the musket was pointed, he raised his
spear, and stood in the attitude of throwing it
until the sentinel came to a shoulder, when he again
took to his paddle; the musket was again presented,
and the Indian, with the same promptitude,
raised his spear, until the sentinel, feeling the
awkwardness of his situation, reported the
circumstance to an officer.  I went forward, and
pointing at the native a pistol loaded with very
fine shot, motioned for him to retire; upon which,
he raised his spear at me, and I discharged the
pistol at his legs, when he dropped his arms and
fled with the greatest precipitation; I afterwards
remarked him outside of all the rest of the canoes,
apparently afraid to come nearer the vessel.
After this example, none of them seemed disposed to
question the authority of a sentinel.
</p>

<p>
The islands we had seen, since our departure
from the Marquesas, resembling each other so
much, and none of them affording indications of
water sufficient for our purposes, we began to
think seriously, that we might experience great
inconvenience, and perhaps suffering, before we
could procure a supply; we determined, therefore,
to let no opportunity escape us, of examining
every island that came in our way, if it could
be done without too much risk.  With a view to
this object, the captain pulled in shore, followed
by nearly all the canoes; but when he arrived at
the edge of the surf, which was so heavy as to
make the landing difficult, he remarked that the
people on shore, of whom a great many were
assembled, had all armed themselves with spears
and stones.  This hostile appearance, together
with the violence of the surf, made him hesitate
about proceeding further, although the natives,
on shore as well as those in canoes, pressed him
to land.  When, finally, he relinquished his
object, and was about to return on board, the people
on shore dashed into the water and swam off, and
uniting with those in the canoes, made a violent
attempt to drag the boat into the surf.  The men
promptly repelled them, when they dived to the
bottom, and coming up, showered a volley of stones
into the boat, which wounded a few of the crew
slightly, and broke several pieces of the gunwale.
In the midst of the excitement and confusion that
prevailed, a native seized a pistol, which he
struggled violently to carry off, until a musket was
fired, and he was taken into the nearest canoe
severely wounded; it had the effect to disperse the
natives, who fled from the boat in every direction,
as she returned to the schooner.  When she was
hoisted in, they came alongside, and some of them
got on board.  We commenced getting underway,
and one of the anchors was already up; the
other having hooked to a coral rock, the captain
directed the sentinel forward, to give the musket
to him, and repair to his station.  A native, who
had been talking to the captain, embracing a
favourable opportunity, seized the musket, upon
which was a fixed bayonet, and jumping overboard
with it, swam towards the shore, keeping
half the time under water.  Muskets were fired
at him, but he bore his booty safely through the
surf to the coral bank, where, although he was
still within striking distance, he marched away
with the most perfect composure, until he
disappeared in the bushes.
</p>

<p>
After this bold theft, several boats were prepared
to land in search of water, and, if possible,
recover the stolen property.  The captain took
the lead, and landed on the coral bank, with his
arms and ammunition wet and useless, whilst the
boat, in returning through the surf, was thrown
upon the rocks, bilged, and before she finally got
off, almost every timber in her broke.  This
fatality having attended his landing, he forbade the
other boats to attempt it, choosing rather to
remain in his defenceless situation, surrounded by
hostile natives, to the more serious consequence of
losing the remainder of his boats.
</p>

<p>
By signals concerted previous to his departure
from the vessel, he directed a fire at intervals
from our cannon, in the direction of a large hut
that we supposed belonged to the chief.  A small
group of natives approached him, one of whom, a
man advanced in years, came up with a green
branch in his hand; the captain demanded of him
by signs the return of the musket, in reply to
which, he addressed some one near him, who ran
off, and in about an hour, brought it without either
lock or bayonet; these were also required, and
our demand repeated occasionally by a discharge
of cannon in the direction of the chiefs hut.  It
was not long before the lock was brought, but no
threats could compel them to relinquish the
bayonet.  The situation of the captain and his party
was becoming more and more critical with every
moment's delay.  They were on a bank of coral
a hundred yards wide, and small parties of
natives, of whom great numbers were assembled in
the bushes, would frequently sally out and throw
stones at them.  They had no other means of
protection or defence than what was afforded by
our guns, which were fired whenever the hostile
parties made their appearance.  The hustle of
our shot over their heads, and the fall of
cocoa-nut trees, proved to them the superiority of our
arms over theirs, and in a measure, had the
desired effect of keeping them back.  One
circumstance, however, convinced us that they were not
yet fully sensible of this superiority, or if so, that
they were intrepid to a degree that might well
alarm us for the safety of our people.
</p>

<p>
When one of their parties had sallied out, there
were two men walking along the beach, carrying
a canoe; a shot that was fired to drive the
sallying party back, struck so near these men, that it
threw the sand and gravel all over them.  They
laid the canoe down and looked round them for a
few moments, when they took it up again and
walked along, as they would have done under the
most ordinary circumstances.
</p>

<p>
When the captain became impatient of his
confined situation on the beach, besieged and
harrassed as he constantly was by the natives, he
made bold to risk an excursion back upon the
island, to show the natives his disregard for them,
and, at the same time, satisfy himself as to the
existence of water.  They did not any where
oppose him or appear in numbers; a few persons
were seen behind the trees, or stealing along
through the thickets without any demonstration
of hostility.  His discoveries were few and
unimportant; the only place where he found water,
was in an old well, where it was stagnant and
unfit for use.  In the huts that he entered, were
stores of dry cocoa-nuts, and a preparation of
dried fish and sea-moss.
</p>

<p>
We were filled with solicitude for our party
when beyond the reach of our assistance, knowing
that they had no other means of safety than
the opinion which might exist among the natives
of their invincibility, and we were highly gratified,
after an hour's watching, to see them returning to
their old place of blockade&mdash;the coral bank.
</p>

<p>
It was now sundown, and the surf had increased
so much that we did not believe it possible for
a boat to reach the shore and return in safety;
and to send men there without a prospect of their
being enabled to return, would be but a useless
sacrifice of lives; but here was our people on
shore; the natives had followed them on their
return to the beach; and their remaining after dark
would probably be attended with the most serious
consequences.  Two men, who were good swimmers,
came forward and volunteered their services
to take on shore a light boat that we had, and
although I might have felt unwilling to exercise
authority in the performance of so hazardous a
service, I was happy to accept the generous offer.
They landed in safety, and the boat being deeply
laden with the captain and his party, they clung
with one hand to her quarter, swimming with the
other, until after a severe and most doubtful
struggle, she emerged from the surf, almost filled with
water, and was soon afterwards alongside.  It
was thought that if there had been one more
breaker to pass, all would have perished.
</p>

<p>
The men of Byron's Island are stout, active, and
well made.  They were all naked, and covered
with scars.  Some of them wore skull-caps, of
grass, and wreaths of dry cocoa-nuts.  Their
ornaments were rude, and worn by but very few.
They consisted of shells and beads, made of
something that resembled whalebone, worn in long
strings,&mdash;by some round the waist, and by others
round the neck.  Their hair was long and matted,
and their complexion very dark.  Their beard
was thin, and curled upon the chin, like that of
the negroes.  A few women came round us in
canoes, who looked coarse, and almost as robust
as the men.  They wore round their loins a small
mat about a foot wide, with a fringe at the
bottom.  But few of the men were tattooed, and they
very slightly.  Their canoes were ingeniously
wrought, of a great many pieces of light wood,
which were laced together by twine, made from
the husk of the cocoa-nut; but they were so leaky
as to keep one man baling constantly.  They
were very narrow, sharp at both ends, and had a
small platform of light wood, on one side, to keep
them upright.  They resembled the canoes of the
Duke of York and Clarence islands, but were
rather narrower, and made with better workmanship.
The canoe sails, of all these islands, are
mats of straw or grass.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the captain returned on board, we
got underway, and bade adieu to Byron's Island,
and its inhabitants, whose acquaintance had been
productive of nothing but anxiety and perplexity.
We run off W. by S., and in three or four hours
made Drummond's Island, ahead, distant three or
four leagues.
</p>

<p>
At daylight, we passed a reef of considerable
extent upon the N.E. end of the island, and ran
down upon the west side of it.  When we had
approached the shore, within the distance of a
league, canoes made their appearance in every
direction, sailing off to us.  We stood in, and
found anchorage within two cables' length of the
bank of coral, that stretched one or two miles
from the shore, and which, at low water, was
almost every where dry.  Here we hove to, having
in sight, along the shore, twenty or thirty
large villages, besides other habitations, that
were thickly interspersed amongst the trees
beyond it.  The island, indeed, was swarming with
inhabitants, and, from its extent and forest of
cocoa-nut trees, seemed well adapted to sustain a
large population.  It was low, and being quite
level, promised but a poor prospect of affording a
supply of water.  We had not been long hove to,
before we were surrounded by from one to two
hundred canoes, having in each of them, with few
exceptions, two men and a woman, the latter of
whom was kept constantly employed baling the
water out.  They betrayed a greater degree of
timidity than the natives of any island we had seen
before, keeping in their canoes, at a distance from
us, or approaching, with caution and distrust.  At
length some of them got on board, and others
hung upon the sides of the vessel, talking and
exchanging their cocoa-nuts, and flying-fish, for old
nails, or pieces of tin.  One of them, an interesting
looking youth, was noticed by one of the
seamen, who made him several presents, and in
other respects, treated him very kindly.  The
youth appeared to be sensible of the favour shown
him, and expressed his gratitude by smiles, and
by repeatedly patting the sailor on the shoulder;
but, after this dumb show had been going on for
some time, and when his patron's face was turned
from him, he snatched his hat from his head, and
jumped overboard with it, making his way as
expeditiously as possible to the nearest canoe.  The
canoe took him in, and pulled off dead to windward
of us, until they were out of our reach,
although we threw several shot over their heads,
to convince them of the danger they encountered
in such bold adventures.  From our first stopping
place, we ran down a few miles, followed by all
the canoes, which were joined by many more.
Some of the natives again came on board, and one
man, to whom the captain had made presents,
seized upon a fixture of the waist-boat, and
abruptly took his leave.  He was as suddenly
saluted with a charge of bird-shot, from a pistol,
but manfully clung to his prize, and bore it off in
triumph to his canoe.  Aided by his companion,
he was playing us the same trick, as the fellow
who stole the sailor's hat.  But a few shot over
their heads brought them to, when they lay down
in the bottom of the canoe, until we lowered a
boat, and sent it to them.  When they saw the
boat approaching, they took to their paddles, and
made an effort to escape; but, finding that
impossible, jumped overboard, and continued diving
from one side of the canoe to the other, until they
were taken.  They trembled excessively, expressing
a great deal of alarm, upon being brought on
board, and made several attempts to escape.  The
captain inflicted upon the thief, a punishment, that
he thought might be a useful admonition to the
natives, in their future intercourse with white men,
when, with his companion, he jumped overboard,
apparently delighted, in having escaped so well.
The number and enterprising character of the
people, changed our purpose of attempting to
obtain a supply of water, by digging wells.  And,
besides the above objection, it was to be expected
that, in the performance of our duty, at the
Mulgrave Islands, it would be necessary for us to
explore the whole group, where, within so great a
compass, our wants could scarcely fail to be
supplied.  Accordingly, in the evening, we made
sail, and, after clearing the island, hauled up to
the northward and westward.  The inhabitants
of Drummond's and Byron's Islands, were, in all
respects, similar to each other, even to their
canoes and sails, the latter of which was a coarse
matting of grass.
</p>

<p>
During our passage from Drummond's Island to
the Mulgraves, which was of nine days' duration
we had squally weather, and were constantly
affected by violent currents, for which, as they
were irregular, no allowance could be made.  On
the second day after our departure from Drummond's
Island, our safety was considerably endangered
from this cause.  Being near a chain of
small islands belonging to the Kingsmill Group, the
weather thick and squally, we stretched off,
calculating that, at meridian, on the following day,
we should be thirty miles to the northward of
them; but, to our surprise, when at meridian the
weather cleared, and we got our observations,
instead of being thirty miles to the northward, we
were as much to the south, having been carried
through them by a current at night.  We were
two or three days in the vicinity of the Mulgraves',
laying to at night, and drifting with the current
nearly as much as we advanced through the day,
with light and baffling winds.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of November, the nineteenth,
the welcome hail of "Land! ho!" was given,
and shortly afterwards it was seen from the deck,
two leagues off.  It proved to be the easternmost
of the Mulgraves', for which we run down on the
following morning, and anchored on the lee shore,
within less than a cable's length of the surf, in six
fathoms water.
</p>

<p>
The island was low, of coral formation, and, in
all respects, resembled Caroline, Clarence, York,
Byron's, and Drummond's Islands.  The
inhabitants were not numerous, and differed from all we
had seen before in dress and manners.  They
gave us a most kind and hospitable reception,
freely offered whatever any of us expressed a wish
for, and in all respects acquitted themselves in a
manner highly satisfactory.  Near our landing
place we had the satisfaction to find two or three
old wells of water, which, after being cleared out,
would afford us a supply without much labour in
getting it off, the landing being tolerably good.
</p>

<p>
On the twenty-first and twenty-second of November,
we filled our water-casks, and, with several
parties, explored the island.  In our search
we found a whaler's lance, and several pieces of
old canvass; but all our efforts to obtain a
knowledge, from whence they came, or of the persons
who brought them, were unavailing.  Some of the
natives came on board, all of whom were neatly
ornamented.  They wore wreaths of flowers round
their heads, bracelets and necklaces of beautiful
shells; a large roll of leaves, from one to two
inches in diameter, through slits in their ears, and
as a covering for their loins, two bunches of a
kind of grass, that resembled hemp, hanging below
their knees, one bunch being behind, and the
other before.  Nothing was stolen by them.  They
behaved in a most orderly manner, looking round
the deck inquiringly, or seated themselves, and
chatted familiarly with our people, taking pains to
make themselves understood.  In their look and
action they appeared to be lively and intelligent;
but whenever the subject of our visit was pressed
upon them, by pointing to the whaler's lance, they
became silent, pretending to be ignorant of our
meaning.  The activity of our exploring parties,
in traversing all parts of the island, and our close
examination of every thing amongst them, that
had belonged to the whites, produced a sensible
alarm by the third day; and, besides the desertion
of their habitations by some of them, a large canoe
was missing, that had departed from the island
during the night.
</p>

<p>
Beyond us, to the south and west, was a range
of islets, as far as we could see from the
masthead, and having thoroughly explored the island,
where we were anchored, completed our watering,
and made such repairs upon the vessel as were
necessary, we determined to proceed further in
that direction.  At our anchorage here the wind
several times changed from blowing off shore,
which, as we had not room to ride in shore of our
anchor, made it, upon such occasions, necessary
to get underway, and stand off.  At such times,
we remarked, with particular satisfaction, the
advantage we possessed in our vessel, being schooner
rigged, as none but a fore and after could, with the
same facility, have performed the delicate operation
of getting underway, and crawling off, when
riding upon a lee shore, within a few fathoms of
the rocks, to have touched which would inevitably
have been attended with shipwreck.
</p>

<p>
Upon the island, besides cocoa-nut, there were
a few bread-fruit trees, growing in great
luxuriance.  The golden yellow fruit, with which the
females of Nooaheeva ornamented their necks,
grew here in the greatest abundance, and was
eaten by the natives almost constantly, who called
it bup.  A species of small rat, with a tuft of hair
upon the tail, was very numerous, and so tame,
that hundreds of them were constantly feeding
about the huts.
</p>

<p>
The first land we approached in proceeding to
the southward and westward, was a narrow islet,
made up of dry reefs, and verdant spots, from one
to two miles long, and two hundred yards wide.
On most of the islets grew cocoa-nut, and bread-fruit
trees,&mdash;the invariable indication of inhabitants.
They were, however, but thinly inhabited.
Some of the reefs that connected them were
covered with water sufficiently for the passage of a
boat.  The captain landed upon the eastern
extremity, where he found a few people, most of
whom fled at his approach, and such as remained,
were so timid, that we could hardly look upon
them as the countrymen and near neighbours of
the natives, who had treated us with so much
kindness at our anchorage.
</p>

<p>
A small canoe came off, paddled by one man,
who ventured on board, and looked round for a
few minutes, when he departed, without seeming
to have had any other object in view than to
gratify his curiosity.  We should have suspected him
of being a spy, had we not believed these people
too simple, to adopt such an expedient of civilization.
This we, however, afterwards ascertained
was the capacity in which he came, having been
sent by the principal chief of all the Mulgrave Group.
</p>

<p>
The schooner coasted along the islands, keeping
way with the captain, who continued on to
the westward, examining all parts of it.  Beyond,
in what we afterwards ascertained was an inland
sea of great extent; several large sail canoes were
discovered coming from a distant islet.  The
captain crossed the reef into the inland sea, where
he found the water smooth, but every where
filled with shoals of coral.  Without indicating a
wish to examine the canoes, which might have
caused them to put back, he soon afterwards
returned on board, and another boat was sent to
continue the examination of the islet, as we
advanced.  The officer prevailed upon some natives,
that he met with, to come near him, and one of
them gave him, in return for a present, some glass
beads.  Upon arriving at the western extremity
of the islet, the captain put off for the shore, where
he found four large canoes hauled up on the beach,
and those he had seen before, coming over the
inland sea, just in the act of landing.  As we
afterwards ascertained, it was the high chief of
the Mulgrave Group, with from fifty to a hundred
of his chiefs and warriors, on a cruise of
observation, to satisfy himself who, and what we were,
and what was the object of our visit to his lonely
and unfrequented isle.  None of the chiefs had
any thing to distinguish them, so that we knew
not but that they were here upon some ordinary
pursuit, otherwise, their presence would have
excited in us a much more lively interest.  As it
was, we were gratified to have an opportunity of
seeing so many of the natives, with their canoes,
which we could examine, for proofs of the crew of
the Globe having landed upon these islands, of
which we were already pretty well satisfied from
what we had seen.  The fact was satisfactorily
proved in a few minutes afterwards, by our
discovering upon the platform of their canoes the
lids of several sailors' chests.  On a farther
examination, pieces of cloth and ash-spars were also
found.  The natives were watching our every
look and motion, and notwithstanding their
pretended apathy and indifference, could not conceal
the intense excitement that our close examination
produced amongst them,  It soon gave rise to an
animated conversation, which was accompanied
with angry looks, and the only satisfaction they
gave us, when we pointed to the chest-lids, was a
vacant stare, or a few words of their island
language not more intelligible.  Not far from the
beach was a pleasant grove of cocoa-nut and
bread-fruit trees, through which was scattered a
number of neat little Indian huts.  One of them,
near the shore, was frequented by a great many
of the natives, with whom our people freely
mingled.  It was about ten feet high, and above the
ground; had a small garret, which was screened
from observation by a floor of sticks, thickly
interwoven with leaves.  Although most of the huts
had been examined by our men, it was our good
or ill fortune, that this, where so many were
constantly assembled, should escape observation.  We
should there have found one of the men, as he
afterwards informed us, for whom we were so
anxiously looking; but the discovery might have
been attended with bloodshed, and, perhaps, fatal
consequences to our shore party, than whom the
natives were much more numerous.
</p>

<p>
William Lay, one of the Globe's crew, had
been brought to this islet, by the chiefs, to be
used as circumstances might suggest.  He was
concealed in the garret of the hut, and guarded
by a number of old women, who were directed,
the first whisper of noise that he made, to put
him to death, the chiefs having also denounced
their heaviest vengeance upon him, if he should,
in any way, disclose the secret of his being there.
He lay in this unhappy situation for several hours,
listening to the interchange of opinion amongst
his countrymen, from whose conversation he was
informed of the character of our vessel, and the
object of her cruise.
</p>

<p>
Towards sun-down, when our parties were
weary with the labour of the day, they repaired
on board for the night, and the natives, getting
into their canoes, took their departure from the
islet, and steered away, over the inland sea, until
they were lost in the horizon.  We stood off and
on during the night, and, at nine in the morning,
anchored in nine fathoms water, near our place
of landing.  Here there was a channel into the
inland sea, having nearly water enough for the
schooner, and through which we made an unsuccessful
attempt to pass.  Our situation was now
becoming very unpleasant.  It was necessary for
us to have parties on shore, exploring the islands,
and the remainder of the crew was quite insufficient
to get the vessel underway,&mdash;an expedient
indispensable, whenever the wind came on shore,
as the anchorage hardly ever extended more than
half a cable's length from it.  That we might
lose nothing from delay or want of perseverance,
however, soon after we came to, an officer, with
a party of eleven men, attended by a boat to take
them over the drowned reefs, was sent to march
round, and explore the islets, that formed a
continued chain to the southward and westward of
us.  We felt a conviction, from the conduct of
the natives, that they were unwilling to give us
the intelligence we required, and that we must
depend entirely upon our industry and good
fortune, for any discovery we might make.  In the
evening we sent a boat to communicate with our
party, but they had advanced so far, that she
returned without seeing any of them.
</p>

<p>
On the following day, November the twenty-fifth,
the weather clear and pleasant, a boat was
sent with refreshments to our exploring party, who
were overtaken at the distance of ten miles from
us, just commencing their morning's march.  The
islets, thus far, were narrow, not averaging a
quarter of a mile in breadth, and but thinly
inhabited.  Our party were pleased with the conduct
of the natives they had seen.  They gave them
cocoa-nuts, without receiving any thing in return,
and in the evening, when they stopped to repose
for the night, provided them with huts to sleep in.
The officer of the party, in the course of the day's
march, found a mitten, with the name of Rowland
Coffin marked on it, who, by referring to a list
of the Globe's crew, proved to be one of the boys
left with the mutineers.  From the place where
the party was found, the extent of the island could
not be seen.  I landed at the settlement where
we were anchored, and found the hats nearly all
deserted.  Such of the natives, as remained,
seemed disposed to be very friendly, and followed
me to the beach, where I shot a few sand-snipe,
which drew from them loud shouts of applause,
on witnessing the effect of my musket.  Near the
huts I observed a number of small white cranes,
one of which I shot, supposing them to be wild,
but afterwards regretted it very much, on learning
that they were domesticated, and held in
great reverence by the natives.
</p>

<p>
At five in the morning, November the twenty-sixth,
a squall arose from the eastward, which
struck the vessel adrift, in the direction of the
trending of the land, and, dragging off the bank,
we hove the anchor up, and stood along shore to
the westward.  When we had run fifteen or
twenty miles, we came up with our party, to
whom we sent refreshments, and proceeded on,
passing several remarkable points.
</p>

<p>
At three, P.M., we came to, under a point, by
which we were somewhat protected from the sea,
in ten fathoms of water, and about thirty fathoms
from the coral rocks, where there was but three
feet.  We were considerably in advance of our
party, whom we had now determined should
march round the whole circle of islets, if
information of the mutineers should not sooner be
obtained.  In front of us the islet was wider than
any we had seen elsewhere, and presented a
noble forest of cocoa-nut, interspersed every where
with the broad green leaves of the bread-fruit
tree, which indicated a most luxuriant growth.
Huts were scattered about through the trees, and
some close to the shore, forming a peaceful and
romantic scene.  The landing was good at low
water, and practicable at high tide.  As far as
we could see to the westward, the land still continued.
</p>

<p>
The surgeon, who was very much debilitated,
when we sailed from the coast of Peru, had
gradually, and almost imperceptibly, become more
feeble, and for some time past believed that he
had a disease of the liver.  Until within two days
of coming to our present anchorage, he discharged
his ordinary duties, in attending the sick, when his
mind began to fail, and it was evident to us that the
period of his existence was near its close.  He lay
for a time in a state of insensibility, receiving the
little aid that his friends could afford him; and at
forty-five minutes after four, P.M., November
the twenty-seventh, breathed his last, deeply
lamented by all the crew, to whom he had greatly
endeared himself, by kind and assiduous attentions,
even when he was extremely ill, and knew
that he was fast hastening to the close of life.
In the morning, I took a party of men on shore,
and in a grove, at the foot of a wide-spreading
bread-fruit tree, made the narrow bed of our
departed messmate.  At nine, the vessel struck
adrift, and dragged off the bank.  When she
again stood in towards the shore, we landed, with
as many of the officers and men as could be spared
to bury the doctor's remains, with the honours of
war.  The natives assembled, to the number of
twenty or thirty, and followed us to the grave,
watching all our motions with an expression of
great surprise.  They were silent until the first
discharge of musketry, when they burst into loud
shouts and laughter, for which we drove them
back, with threats of punishment, a considerable
distance from us, where they afterwards remained
quiet.  At the foot and head of the grave we
planted seeds of orange, lemon, and cheramoya,
and upon the bread-fruit tree, at the head of it,
carved his name, rank, and the vessel to which he
belonged.  Below this we spiked, firmly upon the
tree, a brass plate, with his name, age, the vessel
to which he belonged, and the day of his death
inscribed upon it.  A little to the eastward of the
grave we had the satisfaction to find two springs
of excellent water.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning our party arrived,
and, after receiving refreshment, continued on to
the northward and westward.  They crossed a
long reef, that connected the islet abreast of us
with another, at the distance of a few miles, that
had the appearance of a large settlement, from
the immense cocoa-nut forests that rose in that
direction.  Soon after crossing the reef, and
arriving at the extreme east end of the islet, where
it was narrow and sandy, they suddenly came to
a place that was strewed with several hundreds of
staves of beef and pork barrels, and old pieces of
canvass and cloth.  In advancing a little further,
they found a skeleton, lightly covered with sand,
and a box, containing a few Spanish dollars.  The
natives, some of whom had been constantly following
our party, and occasionally mingling with
them, and administering, as well as they could to
their wants, upon approaching this place
disappeared, or were seen at a distance, skulking
through the bushes.  These discoveries excited
the liveliest expectation of soon making others
more satisfactory, and proceeding a mile further,
they found an unoccupied hut, where, night
approaching, they encamped.  Early in the morning
they took up their line of march, and had not
gone far, when it was evident that the natives
were preparing for hostilities.  Groups of them
were frequently seen at a distance, armed with
spears and stones, and holding animated
discussions.  They were much more numerous than
our party, who, upon examining their ammunition,
found it was wet, and that the few arms they had,
which were no other than a pistol, for each man,
were also wet, and unfit for immediate use.  The
officer, therefore, determined to retreat to the
place of his night's encampment, until he could
despatch information of his situation, and ask for
a reinforcement and ammunition.  On arriving
where he had spent the night, he found that the
hut he had occupied was gone, and also that a
large sail canoe, he left there, had been taken
away.  Not a single person was any where to be
seen.  Here he remained, sending two of his party
to the schooner, which was now several miles
from him.  A little after meridian, we received
them on board, and heard, with great interest,
the information they gave.  There was no doubt
in our minds, that this was the place where the
mutineers, and others of the Globe's crew, had
been left,&mdash;but where are they now?&mdash;was a
question, which naturally occurred to us.  We
had given the natives no cause, to excite them to
hostility; but, on the contrary, had taken every
means that suggested itself, to gain their
confidence and esteem.  If they wished to make war
upon us, opportunities had been frequently
presented, when our exploring party might have been
assailed by overpowering numbers, with a prospect
of success, of which they had not availed
themselves, and here they were now apparently
wavering between peace and war, just at the
moment of our discovering the place where our
countrymen had been.  We knew not how to account for
this change in their conduct, but by supposing that
the mutineers were amongst them, and that, from
our near approach, they were becoming alarmed
for their safety, and had roused the natives to
war, with the hope of defending themselves by
open combat.  If this supposition were true, and
it seemed very probable, the situation of our party
was very critical, and no time was to be lost in
giving them the aid they asked for, and renewing
our search with redoubled activity.  The launch
was hoisted out, and fitted with all possible
expedition, and at four, P.M., November twenty-ninth,
sailed with two officers and eleven men,
together with the three belonging to the party,
being all that we were willing to spare from the
schooner, as a bold attempt upon her by a large
party of the natives, led on by an enterprising
and desperate chief, might have placed her and
the lives of all her crew in the greatest jeopardy.
I crossed the reef, which was sufficiently
overflown by the high tide, to admit of it, and ran
down in the inland sea to the encampment of our
party, where I arrived at eight in the evening, and
found them all safe; but looking for our appearance,
with the greatest anxiety.  I allowed the
boat's crew to land, and get their supper in
company with those on shore, preparatory to
commencing their night's work.  When we were
prepared for our departure, and had embarked, I was
greatly chagrined on examining the boat, to find
that the shore party, to whom I had brought fresh
arms and ammunition, had, in their over-anxiety
to be well supplied, deprived me of part of mine,
and I was under the necessity of landing, and
searching, not only the men, but even the bushes,
before I found them.
</p>

<p>
Our party had acquired no information since
morning, but from the discoveries that had already
been made, we felt satisfied, that on the following
day, we should find other traces of the mutineers.
In taking my departure, I stretched off with a fine
breeze, but it was blowing directly from the point
to which I wished to steer.  I suffered the men to
lay down and refresh themselves with sleep,
whilst midshipman S. and myself steered the boat,
and to my regret, in returning back towards the
shore from whence I had started, discovered that
we had lost ground; besides, our boat being
clumsy and badly fitted, we found that we had to
contend with a strong current.  I got the oars
out, therefore, and pulled dead to windward until
day-light, when having proceeded about six miles,
we again made sail to the northward and eastward,
close haul upon a wind; it gradually veered,
until I could head for an island eight or ten miles
from us, which just appeared above the horizon,
and where I designed to land and give the men
breakfast.  When within two or three miles of the
island, I observed a number of canoes leaving
places nearer to me and landing upon it.  Two
canoes had put off from thence, and were standing
for me as I was beating with my clumsy boat to
weather an intervening coral reef; they were
manned with about twenty natives, all armed with
spears and stones.  When they had approached
me pretty near, and were passing under my lee,
I ran alongside to examine them, for which they
gave us a great many cross looks.  As soon as I
suffered them to depart, they immediately returned
to the shore from whence they came, and where
I not long afterwards discovered about twenty
canoes that would carry from twenty to forty men
each.
</p>

<p>
The canoes I had boarded, sailed at least three
miles to my one, and I now discovered the
impossibility of possessing ourselves of the
mutineers of the Globe, whilst they, or the natives, if
friendly, to them, had the disposal of such fleet
vessels, with which to avoid us whenever our too
near approach endangered their safety.  I
determined, therefore, to take possession of all that
were now assembled, even though I should be
opposed by the natives, and reduced to the necessity
of measuring our strength with them.
</p>

<p>
The island was small, producing but few
nut trees, and having but a small number of huts
upon it, notwithstanding which, there were several
hundreds of people assembled;&mdash;a great crowd,
considering the thinly populated state of the islands.
But as this large assemblage could only have been
brought together from some extraordinary cause,
I determined to land and search their huts, and
look round, before I made so wide a breach with
them, as must necessarily result from the seizure
of their canoes.  I was sorry to see, on our
coming near them, that they were sending their
women and children towards the huts, which were at
a short distance from the assemblage of natives;
a movement that indicated a want of confidence
in us on their part, or what was still less
agreeable to us, a disposition to hostility.
</p>

<p>
There was some surf on the shore where we
were about to land near the canoes, and that the
boat might be the more readily at our disposal
when we should have occasion for her after
landing, I dropped an anchor, and was in the act of
veering to through the surf, when, to my
astonishment, a person dressed and looking like a
native, addressed us in our own language.  He was
standing upon the beach thirty or forty yards
distant, and half way between us and the natives, all
of whom had seated themselves.  The first words
that we understood, were, "The Indians are
going to kill you: don't come on shore unless you
are prepared to fight."  The scene now presented
to us, inspired an indescribable sensation; for,
although we were convinced that this was one of the
men we were so anxiously looking for, his sudden
and unexpected appearance, his wild attire, and
above all, his warning, seemed like an illusion of
fancy.  His hair was long, combed up, and tied
in a knot on the top of his head; round his loins,
he wore a large mat, finely wrought, and the use
of cocoa-nut oil, and the action of a tropical sun,
for nearly two years, had made his skin almost as
dark as that of the natives.  He earnestly
repeated, several times, that we must not land
unless we were prepared to fight, and described the
plan the natives had concerted with him, which
was, to prevail upon us to come on shore and seat
ourselves amongst them, when, at a given signal,
they would all rise and knock us on the head with
stones.  This statement was probable enough, but
the suspicion that this was one of the mutineers,
very naturally occurred to our minds, with the
questions, "Why have we not found him before? and,
why does he not now fly to us for protection,
if he is innocent?"&mdash;forgetting that our contemptible
numbers precluded all idea of safety to him,
if opposed by the numerous assemblage of natives
by whom he was surrounded.  I asked his name,
which he told me was William Lay, and that he
was one of the crew of the Globe.  His stature
and juvenile appearance, answered the description
we had of him.  I told him to come to the boat,
but he said that he was afraid of the natives, who
had directed him not to advance any nearer to us.
I then directed him to run to us and we would
protect him; but he declined, saying, that the
natives would kill him with stones before he could
get there.  During all this time, they thought he
was arranging their plan for us to come on shore,
and called out frequently to him to know what we
said; to which, he replied in a way calculated to
suit his purpose.
</p>

<p>
After discharging and re-loading our pistols,
with one of which and a cartridge-box each man
was provided, we landed, and marched up to the
place where Lay was standing.  Still doubting
whether he were not more foe than friend, and
determined that, under any circumstances, he
should not escape, I received him with my left
hand, presenting, at the same time, a cocked
pistol to his breast.  I was not insensible to the
sentiment my harsh reception was calculated to
inspire; but circumstanced as I was, I could not
risk every thing in preference to inflicting a
momentary pang, keenly as it might be felt.  I
repeated the question, "Who are you?" to which
he replied, "I am your man," and burst into
tears.  I told him then to say to the natives, that
if they rose from their seats, or threw a stone, we
would shoot them all; but the poor fellow,
delirious with joy for the moment, knew not what he
said, and, instead of obeying my command, called
out in half English, and half Island language, in
broken sentences, most of which was unintelligible
to us; amongst other things, he exclaimed,
"they are going to kill me, they are going to kill
me."  I ordered him to be silent, and then asked,
why he told them we were going to kill
him.&mdash;Recollecting himself immediately, he begged my
pardon, declaring that he knew not what he was
saying.  By this time, some of the natives had
risen, and were becoming very animated and
violent in their conversation and gestures.  Two or
three of them advanced towards us; I pointed my
pistol at them, and made Lay repeat my threat,
which had the desired effect on all but one old
man, who, unarmed, advanced in defiance of me.
Lay desired me to suffer him to approach, which
he did, and taking hold of Lay's hand with both
of his, he asked what his countrymen were going
to do with him.  Lay explained to him, in a few
words, as clearly as he could, at which the old
man seemed much affected.  This was his benefactor,
the person to whom he was indebted for
life; and the poor fellow seemed not wanting in
sensibility or gratitude, at the moment of their
parting.  He embraced him affectionately, told
him that he would see him again before he
departed, and wept like a child.  I was unwilling
to remain longer than was absolutely necessary,
lest the natives, when they had recovered from
their first surprise, should conceive a contempt
for our small number, and make trial of our
strength, in which I knew they would be much
superior to us, if they were determined and brave,
as the first discharge of our pistols would place
us upon an equality with the same number as
ourselves.  I therefore cut short Lay's interview
with his friend, and hastened him to the boat;
there he wept for joy, and gave us several proofs
of the agitated state of his mind.  His first
impulse, which did great credit to his heart, was, to
inquire if his friends were well, and then recollecting
that it was probable none of us knew them, told
us he belonged to East Saybrook, Connecticut, and
asked if any of us were acquainted in that section of
the country.  He several times repeated the same
questions, forgetful that he had asked them
before, and that we had replied in the negative.
When his mind was a little composed, we made
inquiries of him respecting the rest of the Globe's
crew, who had been left on the island; to which
he answered, that they were all dead except
Cyrus H. Huzzy, who was on an island a few miles
to windward of us, and now full in sight.  He
asked, with an expression of great solicitude, if we
would go for Huzzy, and when I told him we
would, it seemed to afford him not less pleasure
than his own deliverance.  He stated that he and
Huzzy both knew that we were in search of them,
and that our vessel was a man of war.  He said
that the chiefs had sent spies on board of the
schooner every day when it was practicable, who
had communicated to them the number of guns
we carried, and, within a very few, the number of
which the crew consisted.  They had apprised
them of the force and conduct of our exploring
party, descending to the minutest particulars, and
even describing most of the individuals on board.
They had seriously debated the question of
making war upon us several times, and always
consulted Lay and Huzzy as to the propriety of it,
and what would probably be their prospect of
success.  They dissuaded them from it, of course,
and filled them with apprehension, by declaring,
repeatedly, that we were invincible, and that there
was scarcely any thing we could not accomplish
with our six-pounders; they even made them
believe, trifling as our armament was, that we could
sink the islands with our cannon: so ready is the
human mind to receive for truth what it cannot
comprehend, if recommended by superior intelligence,
though it may be at variance with every
thing in nature or reason.
</p>

<p>
The natives were told to let us go where we
pleased, without molesting us in any way, to give
us whatever we asked for, and, at all times, to show
themselves friendly to us.  They had strictly
pursued the course of conduct pointed out to them
by the young white men, in whose superior
knowledge of us and our prowess, they placed every
reliance; but still they doubted the probability
of conciliating our friendship in the sequel, and
adhered tenaciously to the idea of accomplishing
our destruction in some way, to make their own
security the more certain.  With this object, a
variety of plans were submitted at different times,
to Lay and Huzzy, by those amongst the chiefs
esteemed the wisest and bravest, all of which were
discouraged, and the success of such an undertaking
in any way, as frequently declared to be
utterly hopeless.
</p>

<p>
One of their plans was, to get alongside of us
at night, unobserved, and with some of the sharp
instruments they had obtained from the Globe,
make a hole in the bottom of the vessel, and sink
her; when, they very truly believed, that those
who were not drowned, would be an easy prey to
them, and that the party on shore, unaided by the
schooner, might soon be overcome and destroyed
by their superior numbers.
</p>

<p>
Another of their plans, and the most plausible
one, was, to assemble secretly all the canoes of
the islands, at some point not distant from us, and
approaching under cover of the night, surprise
and board us.
</p>

<p>
If this last plan had been put into execution, in
a dark night, it is possible that it might have
succeeded, as we could hardly have seen them in
time to use our cannon, and the fire of musketry
which they had heard before, would probably not
have driven them back when they had advanced
near to us, particularly if, as might be apprehended,
at night, the fire were not directed effectively.
They would not have found us entirely unprepared;
for, under the impression that the mutineers
were still living, and on terms of friendship with
the natives, we were on the lookout for such an
attempt being made, as it seemed to be the only
means by which they could possibly escape, and
the plan which would most naturally occur to
desperate men in their situation.
</p>

<p>
In advancing towards the island where we
expected to find Huzzy, Lay told us that the island
where we found him was a favourite place for
fishing at a particular season, when numerous
shoals of fish swam upon its shore.  Our schooner
was anchored at the place of residence of the
high chief, who, with those we found assembled
upon the small island, had fled there to avoid us.
The boat's crew being oppressed with fatigue and
hunger, I landed upon a dry reef, after proceeding
a few miles to give them rest and refreshment.
It was painful to witness Lay's anxiety to depart,
who, fearing a messenger might be despatched to
the chief who had Huzzy in custody, kept his
eyes fixed upon us with an anxious, hurrying look,
and several times expressed his fears that the
chiefs might have the boldness to attempt his
rescue.  On finishing our frugal repast, we pulled up
under an uninhabited point of Lugoma's Island,
(this was the name of Huzzy's chief,) which,
having passed without observation, an ample bay,
upon the shore of which was situated the village
of the chief, opened to our view; and, to our great
joy, the only sail canoe in his possession, was seen
hauled up on the beach.  For a few moments, no
one was seen; but when we were in the act of
landing, Lugoma and several old women came
walking down to the beach, attracted by the
strange and unexpected appearance of our boat.
They were struck with the utmost consternation
at beholding Lay, who was still in his native dress;
and the old women began calling out, in a loud
tone, demanding of him what he was doing there,
and what we wanted.  Before he had time to reply
to them, I got out of the boat, and taking, hold
of Lugoma, and pointing a pistol at him, bade Lay
say to him, that unless Huzzy was brought to me
immediately, I would kill him.  He begged that I
would not hurt him, and said Huzzy was near and
should come to me.  The old women, alarmed
for the safely of the chief, instantly ran off,
calling aloud for Huzzy.  It was but a few minutes
before he appeared, walking towards us, with his
fine yellow hair hanging in ringlets about his
shoulders, and his person quite naked, with the
exception of a piece of blanket, tied round his
loins.  When he had approached sufficiently near,
and I said to him, "Well, young man, do you
wish to return to your country?" his eyes filled
with tears as he replied, "Yes, sir; I know of
nothing that I have done for which I should be
afraid to go home."
</p>

<p>
As soon as Lugoma felt relieved from his apparently
dangerous situation, he began to express
his solicitude for Huzzy, begging that I would not
hurt him; and when he was assured that no
injury was intended towards his son, as has called
Huzzy, entreated me not to take him away.  The
old women united with the chief in the expression
of their wishes, and seemed, by their loud talk and
significant gestures, to insist upon the white man's
remaining with them.  The scene was an interesting
one, and we found a picturesque group assembled
on a beautiful lawn, in front of a number
of huts, surrounded by cocoa-nut and bread-fruit
trees.  Huzzy owed his life to the native chief;
he had been in the condition of a slave to him for
two years.  To him he was indebted for many
acts of kindness, some of which he had requited by
his industry in his service, and some had been
cancelled by harsh treatment; yet, still he stood
in a delicate situation towards the chief.  The
saving of his life alone, conferred an obligation
upon him, which could scarcely be repaid by long
and faithful services.  The chief evidently
appeared to regard him as his son, and when the moment
of our departure arrived, and he saw we were
determined to take our countryman with us, he
joined tears to entreaties, saying he should weep long
and bitterly for him.  He told Huzzy that he
must come back again, and asked me if I would
bring him.  As the only way in which I could get
clear of so strange a petition, urged with so much
feeling, I promised to bring him back if his mother
consented to his return.  With this, he appeared
to be tolerably well satisfied, and we were about
returning to the boat, when Lugoma took Huzzy
aside to talk to him privately.  When their
interview was ended, I asked Huzzy what the
chief had been saying to him; to which he
replied, that he had been reminding him how
difficult it would be for him to get along with his
work without him, and that he must return as
soon as he could, and bring with him some axes,
guns, and cloths, such as his countrymen wore.
"I have promised to bring them," said he, "when
I return, and he is quite satisfied."  When we
were ready to depart, to conciliate the good will
of the female part of Lugoma's family, I presented
them with a variety of trifles, such as finger-rings,
glass beads, &amp;c., for which, in return, they loaded
me with a profusion of small mats, and rude shell
ornaments, accompanied with many expressions
of thankfulness and regard.  When I came to
take leave of Lugoma, I presented him with a
jack-knife.  With the exception of an axe, I
could have given him nothing more valuable, and
it gained for me his unreserved confidence.  He
immediately proposed going with me to the
schooner, and got into the boat with his son, a lad
eight years old.  Huzzy took with him a musket
and a Bible, the only things he had saved at the
massacre.  The first had been preserved for him
by the chief, who thought that with this in
Huzzy's hands, although he had no powder, he was a
match for all his enemies; and the Bible he had
clung to himself, and had kept as the companion
of his lonely hours.  The Bible was more an
object of curiosity to the natives than any thing else
they found in the possession of the white men:
they often inquired of Huzzy what it was, its use,
&amp;c., and his explanations seemed only to increase
their superstition and aversion to it.  They were
never pleased to see him retire to the garret of
his little hut, to read it, as was his custom; and
invariably remonstrated with him against it.  They
urged him frequently to destroy it, and when he
refused, they threatened to do it themselves.  As
the reason of their dislike, they said it would
bring spirits round the house that would kill or
hurt some of the family.  Huzzy told them, that
if they destroyed it, the Great Spirit would come
and kill them all; to which he was probably
indebted for its preservation.
</p>

<p>
I was walking, back of the huts, over a level
green spot, enclosed by cocoa-nut trees, when
Lugoma came to me in great haste, and with a
disturbed look beckoned me to come away, at the
same time saying to Huzzy, that I must not go
there: it was a place for the dead; my presence
would disturb them, and bring spirits round his
huts; I indulged his superstition, and walked off.
Lugoma was about thirty years of age, of moderate
stature, square built, with low forehead, and
flat nose; having an expression of countenance
that indicated intelligence and enterprize.  Huzzy
gave him the character of being very passionate,
inveterate in his enmities, fierce and determined
in his hostility, but firmly attached to his friends,
and possessing a benevolent heart.  He often
became offended with Huzzy, in their ordinary
occupation, and upon such occasions would use violent
language, and sometimes threaten to kill him;
but, when his passion subsided, would be very
sorry for what he had said, and soothe Huzzy by
telling him not to be afraid; he would not hurt
him.  Once, however, in working their canoe,
when something went wrong, he raised a paddle
and struck Huzzy with it, upon which, the poor
fellow, slave as he was, gave way to his indignant
feelings, and was in the act of repaying the chief's
violence with interest, who, seeing that he had
gone too far with the high-spirited white man,
and that his life was menaced, begged him not to
strike, declaring that he would never again raise
his hand against him; and the quarrel was
amicably settled by Huzzy's telling him, that if ever
he did, he would kill him.  From this story, I
thought there might be some truth in the one
which Huzzy told me was one day related to him
by Lugoma's son, the boy that was in the boat
with us.  We had a mulatto lad on board of the
schooner, and at the time our contemplated capture
was spoken of amongst the natives, this little
boy told Huzzy that his father was going to save
the life of the mulatto boy, and then kill him as he
was getting too large.  The mulatto boy was a
great favourite amongst the natives, and upon
several occasions, quarrels had arisen amongst the
chiefs who should have him, when in the presence
of Lay or Huzzy they were debating the question
of our capture.
</p>

<p>
The day was far advanced when we left Lugoma's
Island, and stood along the shores of the
islets to intercept the land party whom we met
at no very great distance, making rapid marches.
We landed to inform them of our success, and that
their labour was at an end, in which they could
not but rejoice with us, although they were
extremely disappointed that they should not
themselves have been the fortunate persons, after all
the toil they had experienced in the search.  We
put off and made sail in both our boats, and as the
canoes were all still upon the beach of the island
from whence we had taken Lay, I intended to
land and get his musket, which, in the hurry of
our departure, he had forgotten.  No sooner,
however, did the natives see both our boats
standing towards them, than they put off with all their
canoes, and bore away directly before the wind.
We made all sail in chase, but soon perceived that
they were leaving us very fast; and, as night
was coming on, we made the experiment of a few
musket shots, fired over their heads, with the hope
of bringing them to.  Instead of answering the
desired purpose, it served only to increase their
alarm, and the weather becoming squally, we
suffered them to depart without further pursuit.
I had cause to regret that I had fired; for from
the first discharge, poor Lugoma was in the greatest
agony, for fear we were going to kill him, as
well as the rest of the chiefs.  All the explanations
that Lay and Huzzy could make, and all
their assurances of my friendship, could not quiet
him.  Several times he would have taken his son
and jumped overboard, had we allowed him to do
so.  Whenever I went to the stern of the boat
where he was sitting, he repeated to me again
and again that he was my good friend, and that
I must not kill him; my replying that I would not
hurt him, that I was his friend, &amp;c., had not the
least effect; it only caused him again to repeat
what he had before told me of, his being my friend,
and that I must not kill him.
</p>

<p>
The numerous shoals of coral, with the violence
of the wind, rendering it somewhat dangerous
to run in the dark, I determined to come to for
the night, as we were yet a long distance from
the schooner.  For this purpose, we stood in
towards the place where, on the preceding night,
we had met the exploring party.  Lugoma no
sooner found himself so near the shore, than he
became more earnest than ever in his petition to
be permitted to land with his son, although he was
more than twenty miles from his home.  I would
have allowed him to leave us, had I not been
apprehensive of the hostility of his countrymen; I
knew not but by his aid in piloting them to our
night's encampment, we might be surprised
before morning, and my resolution to keep him was
confirmed, when it was reported to me, by some
omen who had landed from the other boat, that one
or more natives had been seen near us, skulking
through the bushes.  We also determined, not to
trust ourselves on shore, but to lay in the boat,
and make an awning of our sails, to screen us
from the heavy showers that were frequently
coming over, in the best manner we could.&mdash;When
we had finished our repast, we hauled off
and anchored, but not to sleep.  Our awning was
but poorly calculated for shelter, and the showers
that constantly succeeded each other, kept us too
wet and cold for rest; besides this, I was
frequently reminded of Lugoma's presence, who
made me pay dearly for his detention.  He would
lay no where else than alongside of me, and
during the whole night, not more than ten minutes
elapsed at any one time, that he did not move his
hand over my face, and when he thought my
attention was sufficiently awakened, call out to me,
"Hitera;" a word that signified he was my good
friend, nor would he suffer me to rest a moment
afterwards until I had replied to him "Hitera."
</p>

<p>
We were anchored but a short distance from
the place where the chief mutineer of the Globe
and his murderous companions had landed&mdash;where
he had fallen by their hands, and where
they, in their turn, had been killed by savages.
It was a spot, calculated to revive, in the minds
of Lay and Huzzy, the liveliest recollection of
sorrows and sufferings, that no language could
describe; and as we all wished to hear an
account of the mutiny, and of the events that
subsequently transpired, I desired Lay to favour us
with the relation.  Lay's narrative was as follows:
"The first that I heard of discontent on board
of the ship, was a few days previous to the
mutiny.  I went to the maintop-mast-head, where I
found Comstock; after a few moment's conversation,
he said to me, 'What shall we do, William? we
have bad usage: shall we take the ship, or
run away?'  To this I did not make much of any
answer.  I do not now remember what I said; I
was quite inexperienced, it being my first voyage.
In the afternoon, or the next morning, I heard
him talking to some of the men on the forecastle
about running away with him when we arrived
at Funning's Island, for which, I believe, we were
then steering.  This, I suppose, was for the
purpose of sounding them, to find out their
disposition, and who would join him in the mutiny.&mdash;From
what we heard, we began to think that all
was not right, and tried to get the news aft, but
unfortunately did not succeed.  In the afternoon,
before the night on which the mutiny took place,
we were on the main yard furling the mainsail,
and I tried then to tell the second mate, but Paine
or Comstock was between us, and I was afraid to
say any thing.  Comstock had, some days previous,
taken his cutlass from the cabin into the
forecastle; he was a boat-steerer, and used to eat in
the cabin with the officers.  I knew nothing more
about it until twelve or one o'clock on the night
that the mutiny took place; I was sleeping in the
forecastle, when Rowland Coffin came and awoke
me, saying I must come upon deck, they had taken
the ship.  I got up and went aft, where all the
crew were mustered on the quarter-deck.  When
Comstock had told us what he had done, and what
his regulations were, he said, that such as would
not swear to stick by him, must go on the other
side of the deck.  I did not know how many were
engaged in the mutiny, and believing that we
should be killed if we did not swear, we all swore
to stick by Comstock and obey his orders.  He
then told us to haul the third mate up out of the
cabin; I was one that had to take hold of the
rope made fast to him.  We laid him in the
gangway, and I thought he was dead; but when
Comstock was throwing him overboard, he clung to
the ship with his hands.  Comstock told some one
to bring an axe and cut his hands off, when he
let go and went overboard.  I saw him in the
water astern, swimming after the ship for some
time.  We then made sail; Comstock was the
only navigator on board.  We first went to the
Kingsmill Group, but did not like to stop there, as
the natives were very numerous and thievish;
besides, Comstock had shot one of them for stealing
something; after which, he was afraid to stay
amongst them.  From Drummond's Island, of the
Kingsmill Group, we came directly to the
Mulgraves, and made this part of them, where we
anchored and commenced landing the stores.
</p>

<p>
"The crew of the Globe consisted of between
twenty-five and thirty; but the only persons
engaged in the mutiny were Comstock, Paine,
Oliver, and the black steward, (Lilliston, who was
one of the mutineers he did not mention.)  It was
midnight, and previous to descending to the cabin,
one of the number was placed as a sentinel at the
cabin door, with an axe, Comstock saying to a
young brother who was at the helm, that if he
did not keep the ship in her course, he would kill
him as soon as he came on deck.  Comstock killed
the captain by striking him on the forehead with
an axe whilst he was sleeping, having first locked
the mates up in their state-rooms, that they might
not escape.  He then went with the other mutineers,
and, I believe, cut the throats of the first
and second mates, and shot the third mate.  I did
not see any but the third mate, and was told that
the others were thrown out of the cabin windows.
</p>

<p>
"Not many days after the mutiny, the black
steward was detected in the cabin loading a pistol
which was forbidden on pain of death; and on
being asked by Comstock what he intended doing
with it, he replied, at first, "Nothing;" but, when
questioned more closely, he said that he had
heard Smith and some one else say, they intended
to take the ship.  Smith and the other person
named by the steward, were called up by Comstock,
and asked if they had threatened to take
the ship; to which they replied in the negative,
insisting that they had never intimated or intended
any thing of the kind.  Comstock declared that
such an offence could not go unpunished, and that
the steward must be tried by a court martial; he
thereupon told the steward to choose one man,
and said that he would choose another, and that
the two should sentence the steward to such
punishment as the offence merited.  The two men
were accordingly chosen, the steward selecting
Rowland Coffin for his advocate, and Comstock,
Paine for his.  After hearing the evidence, and
deliberating for a short time, they found the
steward guilty, and sentenced him to be hung at the
yard-arm until he was dead.  Immediately afterwards,
all hands were called to witness the execution;
and the steward was taken forward and
given fourteen seconds to make his peace with
God.[<a id="chap01fn9text"></a><a href="#chap01fn9">9</a>] The foretop-mast steering sail haulyards
were overhauled down and tied round the
steward's neck, and Comstock, after making every
body take hold of the haulyards, held the fourteen
second glass in one hand, and his cutlass in
the other.  When the glass was out, he gave the
signal for the people to run away with the haulyards,
by striking the ship's bell with his cutlass,
and, in a moment, the criminal was run up to the
yard-arm.
</p>

<p>
"After the death of the officers, Comstock
made us all live in the cabin with him, where the
mutineers used to sing, and carouse, and tell over
the story of the murder, and what they had
dreamed.  Paine and Oliver, who could scarcely ever
sleep, spoke with horror of their dreams, and of
ghosts that appeared to them at night; but
Comstock always made light of it, and appeared to
exult in what he had done.  He said once, that the
captain came to him with his wounded and bloody
head, and showed him what he had done, when
he told the captain to depart and never come
again, or he would kill him a second time.
</p>

<p>
"After our arrival here, we made a raft of two
whale-boats and some spars, and on the first or
second day, landed thirty or forty barrels of beef
and pork, sails, rigging, and a variety of other
articles, when Comstock having pitched a tent on
shore, commenced with the mechanics to work on
a whale-boat that he was going to raise upon and
make larger.  Paine was displeased with his doing
this so soon, and sent word to him that he had
better discharge the ship, and then work upon
the boats.  This greatly enraged Comstock, who
hailed the ship for a boat, and on her being sent
to him, came on board.  There he and Paine had
a violent quarrel, and Paine dared him to take a
musket and go on shore with him and fight it out,
which Comstock refused to do.  When he landed,
being afraid that Paine and Oliver would kill him
if he slept in the tent, he went off to pass the
night with the natives; in his absence, Paine and
Oliver agreed to shoot him when he came back;
accordingly, on the following morning, he was
seen coming along the beach alone, "and when he
had arrived within good gun-shot, they
commenced firing at him; without changing his pace,
he continued to advance, and drawing his cutlass,
called out to Paine to stop firing and he would
make peace with him; Paine, however, continued
to fire, and, at the third or fourth discharge,
Comstock fell lifeless upon his face, a ball having
pierced his heart.  Fearing that he might not be
quite dead, and perhaps would get up again, Paine
ran up to him with an axe, and cut off the back
of his neck.  He was buried close to the tent, in
the manner he had often expressed a wish to be,
with all his clothes on, and his cutlass hung to his
side.  Upon first landing, he had fixed upon a
site for a town, and amongst other public buildings
that he contemplated erecting, was a church,
for which he had selected what he considered an
eligible situation.
</p>

<p>
"The natives were all the time so very friendly,
that we were not in the least afraid of them.  A
great many of them came to our tent every day,
and some of them were there day and night, eating,
drinking, and sleeping with us.  Paine had a
girl that he brought from another islet, who did
not like to stay with us, and would run away
whenever she got an opportunity; he fired muskets
at her several times, and at last, used to keep
her by putting her in irons.
</p>

<p>
A few days after the ship ran away, some of
the natives, who had been at the tent, stole from
us a number of tools.  Paine gave four or five of
our people muskets without cartridges, and sent
them to the natives, a great many of whom were
assembled not far off, for the stolen articles.  The
natives refused to give them up, and soon began
to throw stones at our people, who, knowing that
they had not the means of resisting, began to
retreat; the natives pursued them, throwing stones,
and one of the party, Rowland Jones, either fell
or was knocked down by his pursuers, who came
up immediately afterwards and killed him.  When
the party returned to the tent, Paine, who had
taken the command after Comstock's death,
ordered all the muskets brought to him, and locked
them up.  We were all in or about the tent, when
a few hours afterwards the natives came there as
usual, but in greater numbers.  After they had
been there a little while, some one remarked, 'I
am afraid they are going to kill us; they have
all got spears, or stones, or sticks in their
hands.'  Upon this, Paine said he believed we were all
taken, but that he was safe.  The words were
scarcely out of his mouth, when the natives
commenced the massacre, knocking our people on the
head with stones and clubs, and sticking spears in
them.  An old man and his wife laid hold of me,
one on each side, and led me a little way off in the
bushes, where, I thought they were going to kill
me, but where they only held me fast and
protected me from the violence of several who came
and wanted to kill me.  I saw two of the natives
lead Paine off a little way, and thought they were
going to save his life; but they proceeded only a
few yards, when one of them took up a stone and
struck him on the head; he attempted to run,
but a second blow brought him down, and they
immediately afterwards killed him.  Oliver, I did
not see; but the natives told me that he ran a
short distance, when he was overtaken and killed
in the bushes.  A Sandwich Islander that was
with us, got to the water, and was overtaken and
killed there."
</p>

<p>
"Were there any women at the massacre?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, and children too.  The women
seemed to take as active a part as the men.  I
saw one old woman run a spear in the back of
one man, who was held by two natives, with a
degree of violence that seemed far beyond her
strength.  I thought that all but myself were
killed until the following evening.  I had been
taken to the islet where your schooner is
anchored, and where all the chiefs were assembled,
when they brought Huzzy, to show me that there
was one living besides myself.  After an
interview of a few hours, Huzzy was taken away to
live with Lugoma, who had saved his life, and I
was taken to live with the old man who had saved
mine.  He was so very poor that I scarcely ever
got enough to eat of the coarsest native food.  I
had to labour very hard, although I suffered
constantly from hunger, which soon made me weak
and extremely wretched.  At last, the high chief
took compassion upon me, and made me live with
him; after which, I had always plenty to eat,
and was at liberty to work or not, as I pleased.
He was very kind to me in every respect.  They
have always brought Huzzy to me, or taken me
to see him once a fortnight, or once a month, and
suffered us to pass the day together."
</p>

<p>
Here Lay's narrative ended.  Huzzy told us,
that during his residence with Lugoma, his time
had been spent principally on the water, going
with him in his canoe, which required two to work
it.  Lugoma was a great fisherman, and distinguished
amongst the chiefs for his industry and
enterprising character.  He would always have
enough to eat, if he had to steal it.  When Huzzy
would complain to him of the hard and laborious
life that he led, Lugoma would always reply, that
if he would eat he must work.  There seems to be
no doubt, that the natives saved the lives of these
young men from no other motive than that of
making them slaves, and availing themselves of
the advantage of their labour.
</p>

<p>
At the dawn of day, we prepared to depart for
the schooner, and in getting up our anchor, which
was a kedge, weighing upwards of a hundred
pounds, we found that it was hooked to a bunch of
coral at the bottom, from which all our efforts
failed to move it.  As soon as Lugoma saw our
difficulty, he told his son to go down and clear
the anchor.  The little fellow jumped into the
water, which was about three fathoms deep, and in
a few moments came up, making motions for us
to haul away.  He had disengaged the kedge, and
we had no further trouble in getting it up.  It is
a universal practice amongst the natives, whenever
they wish to anchor, to take a line from the
end of the canoe, and tie it to a tree of coral at
the bottom.
</p>

<p>
The chief persisted in his desire to leave us,
saying he was still afraid I would kill him; and
as I had no object in taking him with me against
his will, I consented to his departure, presenting
him with some seeds, the culture of which I caused
to be explained to him, as also the value of the
fruit.  Our return on board was welcomed by
every body.  We had now accomplished the object
of our visit, and the islands were altogether so
void of interest, except for their novel formation,
and the singular habits of the natives, that we
were well content to leave them and return to
some other place more congenial to the feelings
of civilized men.  Before we left, however, we
wished to see the chiefs, and after representing
the impropriety of their conduct toward the white
men who had sought an asylum upon their
islands, point out the course they must in
future pursue towards such as might again visit
them.  On the morning of December the first,
none of the chiefs or people residing upon the islet
abreast of us having returned, the mother of the
high chief was directed to send for her son to come
back, and bring with him the rest of the chiefs,
without delay.  I made a visit to the chief's
village, where I found but few inhabitants, most of
whom were women and children.  It was situated
on the side of the island opposite to us, and
bordering upon the inland sea.  It was not extensive,
but a beautiful and romantic spot; the grove of
cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees, through which
were scattered the huts of the natives, ran about
a hundred yards back from the inland sea to a
wild thicket that passes through the centre of the
islet, in length two or three hundred yards.  Here
I found the largest canoe that I had yet seen.  It
was large enough to carry fifty men, but being
old, leaked so badly, that the high chief was compelled
to leave it behind, in his flight, with all the
rest.
</p>

<p>
Near the high chief's hut, we came to consecrated
ground.  It was the place of burial for the
royal dead.  It was but a small space, comprehended
within the circumference of a few yards,
and at the head of each grave stood a cocoa-nut
tree, bound round with dry leaves,&mdash;a mark that
prohibited the use of the fruit.  We were
accompanied by a son of the high chief, a child about
twelve years old, who desired us not to tread on
the graves of his ancestors.  Two graves were
pointed out, as those of chiefs, who had been
highly distinguished, beside which stood the aged
trunks of cocoa-nut trees, that indicated the period
of their demise to have been very distant.  At
one of the huts we saw a domestic fowl, which,
when I expressed a wish to purchase, the chief's
son, whose name was Ladro, immediately
presented me.  We afterwards saw a number of
others running wild in the thickets.  They were
small, and looked like what is called the bantam.
The natives never eat them, giving, as the reason
for it, that they are not cleanly in their food.  On
our return, Lay took me to a place, where, after
the massacre, he had buried a Spanish dollar.  It
was still there, and he took it with him as a
memento of his captivity.  We passed several
springs of water, to which the women are banished
at a certain period.
</p>

<p>
We met with a native, whom Lay knew, and
who, assuming the native dress, went through
the violent motions and gestures of a Mulgrave
man, engaged in battle.  It was an indescribable
mixture of the frightful and ludicrous.  I was
apprehensive that it would offend the native: but he
laughed with us at the representation, and said, it
was very good.  On the following morning,
December the second, we were disappointed in not
seeing the chiefs.  The captain went again to the
high chief's mother, who made some excuse for
their not appearing, and declared, that they would
positively be up that night by moonlight.  He
told her to send to them again, and say, if they
were not there on the morrow, he would go after
them, and the consequence might be serious.  The
old woman seemed very much alarmed at hearing
such language, and promised a faithful compliance
on the part of her son.  It had the desired effect,
as on the following morning, December the third,
the chiefs all presented themselves on the shore,
near our anchorage.  The captain, taking Lay
and Huzzy with him, went on shore to meet
them.  They told him, by way of opening the
interview, that they were in his power, and ready
to obey all his commands.  He required of them
to restore a whale boat that belonged to the
Globe, a swivel, they had taken from the white
men, and Lay's musket, to all of which they
cheerfully assented.  He then gave them, as a
proof of his friendship, some cotton handkerchiefs,
axes, and a variety of other articles, of much more
value to them than those he had taken.  He told
them, that white men would never come there to
hurt them, and that they must always be kind and
friendly to them, whenever ships should hereafter
visit their island.  That, if other white men should
ever be similarly situated to those they had killed,
they must take care of them, and at some future
time they would be rewarded for it.  They promised
faithfully to do all that they were told, and
regretted having killed our countrymen.  We
gave them a pair of pigs, male and female, which
we told them to take great care of, and increase
the number as much as possible, forbidding them,
on pain of our displeasure, to kill any until we
should again return, which might be at no very
distant period, although it was uncertain when.
The surgeon's grave was made a sacred spot by
the high chief, and every thing about it was to be
held in the same reverence as the burial-place of
his forefathers.  The high chief was instructed,
through the interpreters, in the manner of cultivating
the fruits and vegetables, the seeds of which
we had given him in great variety.  Some we
planted, and all was to be under his especial care.
The use of the various kinds was explained to
him, as well as their importance to ships, that
might visit his islands, which would give him in
return for them, axes, or whatever else was most
valuable to him.
</p>

<p>
On the fourth of December, I obtained a boat,
and set off on a visit to Lugoma, who, contrary
to his promise, had not yet been on board.  I took
Huzzy with me, knowing that it would delight
the chief to see him.  We met with a variety of
obstacles in our passage, through the inland sea,
and did not arrive at the islet of the chief until
the second day after our departure.  We stood
into his bay in the midst of a heavy shower,
notwithstanding which, as soon as he saw us, himself
and son ran down to the shore to meet us, and
waded up to the middle in the water, extending
their arms towards us, full of roasted fish, of
which he had taken a large quantity on the
preceding day.  Both of them called to Huzzy, with
repeated expressions of their happiness at seeing
him, and, in a moment after we struck the shore,
the whole tribe of old women welcomed us, with
their joyful exclamations.  As soon as we were
out of the boat, each one in turn clung round
Huzzy's neck, and embraced him in the kindest
manner.  In several different huts were large
piles of fish, amounting to some thousands, which
had been roasted to preserve them.  Lugoma
offered at once to accommodate us for the night,
saying, he had an abundance of room in his huts
for us to sleep, and plenty of fish for us to eat.
The weather was squally and wet, which induced
me to accept his offer.  I wished, also, to witness
the manner in which he caught fish in such
quantities, and another opportunity might not offer
before I left the islands.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the shower was over, which lasted
for two or three hours, Lugoma went out, and
employed himself busily collecting and breaking
up dry wood, and arranging his ovens of stones,
that all might be in readiness to cook the fish as
soon they were taken out of the water.  There
was a considerable shoal extending out from the
shore, opposite to his huts, upon which the fish, in
their migrations along the islets came in great
numbers.  At the outer edge of this shoal he had
sunk, a few feet below the surface of the water,
a long line of cocoa-nut leaves, which were dry,
and of a reddish colour.  One end of the line of
leaves was taken to the shore, and made fast,
where there was a pen, built of stone.  The line
was then taken round upon the shoal semi-circularly,
encompassing a considerable portion of it,
and the space between the other end of the line
and the shore left quite open.  When a school of
fish is seen, the natives intercept them, driving
them through this open space, and, pressing
forward, finally into the stone pen, from which they
are taken with nets.  After all the arrangements
were made, Lugoma and another native, waded
out beyond the line of leaves, to watch the schools
of fish, but, unfortunately, he allowed them all to
escape; and, as well as ourselves, seemed to be a
good deal disappointed with his bad success.  What
appeared to be most remarkable about this
method of catching fish, is that, after they are
inclosed, they will not pass under the cocoa-nut
leaves, although there is a depth of several feet
water between them and the bottom.  Lugoma
took me to the place where he had planted the
water-melon seeds, I gave him at the time of our
parting.  He had cleared and mellowed the
ground with care, preparatory to planting the
seeds, which were already up, and looked thrifty.
I bestowed upon him a great deal of praise, and
planted a variety of other seeds, of fruit and
vegetables, of which he promised to have an
abundant supply for me, when I should again
return.  When night came, and the hour of repose
was at hand, I was perplexed with the difficulty
of providing for our security against surprise or
treachery, without giving Lugoma reason to
suppose that we did not confide in his friendship,
which I knew he would infer, from any particular
watchfulness on our part.  I did not believe that
we had reason to apprehend danger from Lugoma
or any one else, but as we were exposed to it, and
had the means of security, I was determined not
to run any risk.  Three of the men were sent to
sleep in the boat, anchored off a short distance from
the shore, and which Lugoma was told no one
must approach.  The rest were directed to bring
their arms on shore, and keep a lookout through
the night, in rotation.  When the arrangement
was made, and we had all lain down, except the
man that was standing sentry, Lugoma saw him,
and asked, if there was not room enough for him
to lay down.  We answered evasively several
times, with a view to satisfy the uneasiness he
expressed, lest he should be thought wanting in
any respect in hospitality; but were at last
obliged to tell him, that the man was keeping
watch, to see that no one came to hurt us.  His
mortification was evident, as he remarked, in
reply, that no one would come to his island to hurt
us.  We expressed our full confidence in his
friendship, giving him the further information,
that it was our custom always to have some one
on the look-out.  Lugoma arranged mats upon
the floors of his huts for us all, and invited me to
lay down on one side of him, having his wife and
daughter on the other side.  It blew and rained
hard all night, but the morning was clear and
pleasant.  We set off on a visit to an islet a few
miles beyond that of Lugoma.  He offered to go
with us, and dive for a large shell-fish, found
there; but as we could not take him, without
incommoding ourselves, we declined his company.
The islet was so uninteresting, as hardly to repay
us for the trouble of going to it.  It was covered
with a thick growth of hard red wood, common to
most of the low islands, and wild bup.  We soon
took our departure from it, and returned to
Lugoma's islet, at an early hour of the day.
</p>

<p>
For the first time, at the Mulgraves', I observed,
in one of Lugoma's huts, a drum, resembling
those of Nooaheeva, but of small dimensions.
I supposed it was an instrument of music, and
in compliance with my request, Lugoma readily
consented to play on it.  Calling his daughter to
him, he bade her thump upon it with her hands,
whilst he sung, in time with the music, a few
short lines, throwing himself in a variety of
attitudes, alternately extending one arm, with great
vigour, and drawing the other to his breast.
Upon inquiring what was the subject of his song,
he told me, through Huzzy, that it was the
massacre of the white men,&mdash;a rudeness, I did not
expect,&mdash;even from the untutored Lugoma.  I
declined any further display of his musical powers.
When we were preparing to return on board,
Lugoma came to me several times, saying, that I
might just as well cut his throat, as to lake Huzzy
away from him.  "I have no one," said he, with
a distressed look, "that is equally capable of
assisting me, to work my canoe, and now, he is
going away with his musket, my enemies can
come and kill me."  Finding, at last, that he
could not prevail upon us to leave Huzzy, he
said, we must bring him back very soon.  That,
if we were long absent, we should not find him
living.  He said, that we must bring him clothes,
like ours; guns and axes; and that we should
share the government of his islet with him,
promising to have an abundant supply for us, of all
the fruits and vegetables we had planted.
</p>

<p>
When he and the old women had taken an affectionate
leave of Huzzy, he requested me to take
two or three females in my boat, with their
baskets of fish, which were intended as a present to
the high chief, and land them upon the islet
where he lived.  We consented to do so, and,
after landing them, arrived on board late in the
afternoon, the schooner having run down to the
Globe's anchorage, where she was now lying.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning Lugoma made his
appearance on the beach, with his little son,
having landed with his canoe upon the opposite side of
the narrow islet.  A boat was sent to bring them
off.  The chief stared wildly round, astonished,
and wondering at every thing he saw.  He
was very timid, and, notwithstanding our kind
reception, appeared to feel extremely doubtful
of his safety.  His confidence was in a measure
gained, however, when we gave him an axe, a
piece of cotton handkerchiefs, and some other
trifles; and he left us, reminding me of my
promise to return.  Not long after his departure we
got underway, and ran back to the residence of
the chiefs, where, at ten, A.M., we came to in
our old anchorage.
</p>

<p>
The captain went on shore, and at two, P.M.,
December the eighth, returned on board with the
high chief, and two others.  They were shown
every thing about the deck, but without awakening
much apparent curiosity.  We then beat to
quarters, and let them see what a formidable
appearance we made, arrayed for battle,&mdash;an
appearance, truly ridiculous to one accustomed to
the imposing effect of a fine ship of war, and
calculated to excite our risibility, notwithstanding
the seeming gravity we assumed for the occasion.
The captain asked the high chief, if he did not
wish to hear one of the cannon fired, to which he
answered evasively, unwilling, I suppose, to
acknowledge his fears, as he had been a great
warrior in his time.  The captain then told him, that
he would have one of them fired, if he was not
afraid, which brought the chief to a confession,
that he dared not hear it.  The chiefs brought a
number of presents for the Tamon,[<a id="chap01fn10text"></a><a href="#chap01fn10">10</a>] as they called
the captain, consisting principally of mats.
</p>

<p>
When they became tired of remaining on board,
and expressed a wish to be sent on shore, we
gratified them, and got underway.  The high
chief's son, who had visited me a number of times
before, and to whom I had made presents of
trifling value, but important to him, came on
board with his father, and expressed a wish to go
with me.  His father gave his consent, being
perfectly willing that he should go; but as there was
great probability an opportunity would never offer
for him to return, I thought it would be cruel to
take him from his native islands, where, in his
father's inheritance, he would be so well provided for.
</p>

<p>
It was late in the evening when we got underway,
at the Mulgraves, for the last time.  We
had surveyed all that part of the islands intervening
between our first anchorage and the Globe's
landing, and now steered to the eastward by the
bearings we had previously taken.  Squalls of
wind and heavy rain coming on, we soon lost sight
of the land.  The loud roaring of the surf, off the
extreme north-eastern point, as well as the heavy
swell that set in immediately afterwards, apprised
us that we had cleared the group.  The land was
in sight from the mast-head, in the morning, when
we ran down for the eastern end of the island,
where we had first anchored, and at a convenient
distance run along upon the weather side, taking
hearings at the end of every base of three or four
miles.  Near the centre of the windward part of
the group we passed a wide opening into the
inland sea, not far from which was a reef of
considerable extent, where a very high surf was
breaking.  Within a short distance of the reef, we saw
the bottom plainly in ten fathoms water.  There
was no place on the weather side of the islands,
where it was possible to land with any degree of
safety.  After passing the extreme northern point
we steered off, with the trending of the land
W. by S.; and, at sun-down, were up with the island,
from whence I had taken Lay, having sailed nearly
round the group.  Here we hove to for the night.
</p>

<p>
The group of Mulgrave Islands, as they are
called, form a circular chain of narrow strips of
land, which are no where more than half a mile
wide, inclosing within the circle an inland sea, one
hundred and forty miles in circumference, filled
with shoals and reefs of coral.  It is every where
bounded on the sea-side, by a bank of coral, that
protects it from the violence of the ocean.  This
bank generally extends but a short distance from
the shore, when it goes off into unfathomable water.
At the chief's islet, where we buried the surgeon,
it was wider than at any other place about the
group, being upwards of a cable's length, which,
for a low coral island, may be considered good
anchorage.  The whole circle is broken alternately
into clumps, a few feet above the water, of
level and low coral reefs, some of which are above
high-water mark, and some sufficiently low to
afford a passage for boats.  The clumps vary in
length, but none of them are more than two miles
long, without an interruption of a dry or drowned
reef.  They are covered with a thick growth of
bushes, and trees of small size, except where the
cocoa-nut and bread-fruit trees rear their tall
heads, and wide-spreading branches.  Wherever
these grow, the underwood disappears, and the
place has the appearance of an old forest, cleared
for a pleasure ground, where a few trees have
been left standing, for the advantage of their
shade.
</p>

<p>
The bread-fruit tree is of two kinds.  One is
the same as that, which is found at the Society,
Sandwich, and many other islands of the Pacific.
This has no seed, and can only be produced by
cuttings from the tree, or shoots, that spring up
from the roots.  The other kind is seminal, and
very much superior to the first.  It was not the
bread-fruit season, when we were at the
Mulgraves, and much to our regret, we could not
obtain any of the seeds of this rare and valuable
plant.  This tree, in general, attains a size
considerably larger than that of the common
bread-fruit.  The leaf of the bread-fruit tree strongly
resembles that of the fig, and any one, who has
seen the latter, would immediately recognise it,
by the resemblance, and the fine rich foliage it
bears, when growing luxuriantly.  This is by far
the most important production of the Mulgrave
Islands.  When the fruit is not blasted, as
sometimes happens, there is a great plenty for the
inhabitants.  It lasts, however, only for a few
weeks; and it is to be presumed, that the natives
have no way of preserving it, in a dried or baked
state, as is practised with many of the South Sea
Islanders, none having been seen by us during
our stay.  The cocoa-nut tree is next in value to
the natives.  Of this food there is an ample
supply, unless the fruit is blasted.  When the
bread-fruit and cocoa-nut, both fail in the same year,
the natives experience great distress, and are
reduced to the necessity of living upon a fruit, they
call bup.  It is commonly used by the poorest
people, and in small quantities by the chiefs at all
times.  It grows upon almost all the islands in the
West Pacific; but, when wild, is much inferior to
that growing on the trees, which have a clear
open space around them.
</p>

<p>
Lay lived upon the wild bup for a considerable
time after the massacre, when residing with the
poor old man, who saved his life, and before the
high chief took compassion on him.  It has a
sweet taste, like the juice of a green corn-stalk.
Bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, and bup, is the only food
of the inhabitants of the Mulgrave Islands, except
at the season of the year, when great numbers of
fish are taken.  The industrious and enterprising
have an abundant supply at that period; but it is
only whilst the season lasts, as they are not in
the practice of preserving them.  The bup-tree is
the most remarkable of all the vegetable productions
of the Mulgrave Islands.  To shipwrecked
seamen, it might be the means of sustaining life,
when no other food could be found, and, as it is a
never-failing resource, it ought to be generally
known amongst those, who navigate the Pacific
Ocean.  The tree generally grows from twenty
to thirty feet high,&mdash;sometimes singly, but more
frequently in small clusters.  The diameter of
the body rarely exceeds six inches.  It has a hard
thick bark, but the wood is spongy, like that of
the cocoa-nut tree.  It stands on from half a
dozen to a dozen roots or prongs, by which it is
propped up two or three feet from the ground.
The fruit is an exact resemblance of a pine-apple.
Its smell, when ripe, is at first agreeable, but, so
powerful, that it soon becomes offensive.  The
taste of the ripe fruit has much the same
effect&mdash;agreeable at first, like a mellow, sweet apple, but
cloying and nauseous to the stomach, when taken
in any quantity.  The ripe fruit is never eaten by
the natives of the Mulgraves.  When green, it is
not considered in a state to be eaten, until a
beard, which grows out alongside of the stem, has
acquired a length of four or five inches.  It may
then be taken from the tree, and eaten raw, or
roasted between hot stones.  The soft part of
the seeds (if I may so call them) is alone
palatable, the other part being hard and tough.  The
manner of eating it is, to twist the soft part off
with the teeth, whereby the juice is expressed.
There was but little about the islands that would
excite the interest of either the botanist or
naturalist.  We saw but few flowers or plants.  The
islands were swarming with a species of small
rat, that had a tuft of hair upon its tail.  The
natives spoke of them as being very troublesome.
By throwing a small quantity of food upon the
ground, near one of the huts, dozens of them
could be collected together in a few moments.
</p>

<p>
When one of the natives is sick, the friends
collect at the hut, where he is lying, and chant
over him, to appease the offended spirit that has
afflicted him.  The same prescription is given for
all diseases, which is a tea, made from an herb
found upon the island.  If death takes place, the
friends of the deceased assemble, and mourn over
the body, keeping it until it becomes very
offensive.  Frequently, in the midst of their most
bitter mourning and lamentation, some of the
mourners will intentionally say or do something
calculated to excite mirth, when they all burst
out into immoderate laughter, as if their mourning
were the affectation of children, and as soon
as the humorous excitement has passed over,
again relapse into their mournful strain of howling
and chaunting.  When the body can be kept no
longer, and the day of interment arrives, the
grave is dug, and the corpse taken upon sticks,
and carried to it by the friends of the deceased,
followed by a large concourse, who move along
without order, and some one occasionally breaks
in upon their solemnity by a humorous trick,
which gives rise to others, and sets them all
laughing.  This is soon again succeeded by
mourning.  The body is lowered into the grave, and
covered up, when a little canoe, with a sail to it,
and laden with small pieces of cocoa-nut or other
food, having been previously prepared, is taken
to the sea-shore on the leeward part of the island,
and sent off, with a fair wind, to bear far away
from the island the spirit of the deceased, that it
may not afterwards disturb the living.  This
ceremony is considered indispensably necessary,
and is never neglected.  At the head of the grave
a cocoa-nut is planted, the tree that springs from
which, is held sacred, and its fruits never eaten,
in times of the greatest famine.  Their burial
places are usually a short distance back of the
houses, and the females are strictly prohibited
from going to them.
</p>

<p>
Their marriages are conducted with but little
ceremony.  If a man fancies a female for his
wife, he makes the proposal to her, which, if
agreeable, he applies to her friends.  They meet,
and hold a consultation, as to the propriety of the
match, and decide whether it shall take place.  If
the man's suit is denied, nothing more is said on
the subject.  When united, they are said to be
very faithful, and jealous of each other's chastity.
Lay or Huzzy related an occurrence, that took
place during their residence on the islands, which
shows how keenly a sense of injury is felt by
them, and that jealousy sometimes inspires them
with the most ferocious and deadly revenge.  A
young man had taken a young woman for a wife,
whom he supposed to be a virgin.  In a very
short time after she went to live with him,
however, it was evident that she was pregnant, and
before the period which nature has prescribed had
elapsed, gave birth to a child.  The indignant
husband took the infant from its mother's arms,
and in her presence dashed its head upon a stone
in front of his hut.  It was an act for which,
under other circumstances, he would have suffered
death, by a custom of the islands, forbidding the
destroying of human life; and, as the female was
of superior rank to the man, being the daughter
of a chief, it was believed that he would be
punished.  Her friends were loud in their calls
for justice upon the offender, until a council of
the chiefs was called, and the matter brought
before them.
</p>

<p>
After an investigation, the chiefs were satisfied,
that the woman had grossly imposed upon her
husband, whom they suffered to depart without
censure.  It is permitted to the men to have as
many wives as they can get; but as food is very
scarce, and they find it difficult to support one,
there are few, even of the chiefs, who have more.
The high chief was the only exception to this
remark at the time of our visit.  He had six, one
of whom was a particular favourite.
</p>

<p>
Latuano, the high chief of the Mulgraves, was
called the greatest warrior that the islands had
produced for a long time.  He told us that in one
of his wars he was driven from his islands, and
remained (I think) fourteen days at sea in his
canoe, most of the time out of sight of land.  He
steered for an island, which, according to the
tradition of his countrymen, lay to the west of the
Mulgraves, and, after a great deal of suffering,
arrived there in safety.  The high chief of this
isle (south Pedder's Island) received him with
kindness, and after he had visited thirteen
different islands of the group,[<a id="chap01fn11text"></a><a href="#chap01fn11">11</a>] sent him back to the
Mulgraves with a fleet of canoes, and a great
many men.  He arrived there in safety,
conquered his enemies, and at the time of our visit
was tributary to the chief of Pedder's Island, who
had given him a daughter or grand-daughter in
marriage.  They told us that every few years
the chief of Pedder's Island, who is very powerful
and very wise, sends a fleet of canoes to the
Mulgraves, for tribute.  Lay and Huzzy were to
have been sent to him, as also the Globe's
whaleboat and swivel.  I was particularly struck with
Latuanos' strong resemblance to General Bolivar.
His stature was about the same, and his face bore
the same marks of care and serious thought, when
his attention was not awakened to any particular
thing; and, when animated by conversation, the
same vivid expression beamed from his fine
features, and sparkling black eyes.  I could not but
think, when I was looking at him, that if he and
General Bolivar could be placed near to each
other, similarly dressed, it would be difficult to
tell which was the Indian chief, and which the
patriot hero.
</p>

<p>
The high chief is absolute in his authority, but,
in the administration of justice, particularly where
the life of an individual is concerned, he is
influenced in passing judgment by the opinion of
the chiefs of most consequence.[<a id="chap01fn12text"></a><a href="#chap01fn12">12</a>]  Like all
other men, whether civilized or uncivilized, they
have different grades of rank in their society,
from the high chief down to the farthest remove
of relationship to royalty.  The different islets
that are inhabited, are partitioned off to different
chiefs, who acknowledge their subordination to
the high chief, by sending him a part of whatever
grows, or is taken within the limits of their
government.  They send him a portion of their
cocoa-nuts, bread-fruit, and bup, and of the fish
or birds, that may be caught by themselves or any
of their people.  The high chief requires this for
the support of his numerous family.  Besides his
wives and children, he usually keeps a large
number of men about him, who go in his canoe, and
perform other essential duties in his service.
Several of the principal chiefs are also in attendance,
and live with him constantly.  In his family, there
is no ceremony, to remind the common people of
their lowly condition.  They all eat, drink, and
sleep alike.  In dress, there is nothing to
distinguish the chiefs from the common people, except
that the former sometimes wear a mat that comes
down to the knee, of straw, and finely wrought.
This, however, I believe, is only worn upon
particular occasions.
</p>

<p>
The men wear bunches of grass hanging down
before and behind, such as I have described at
our first anchorage, being about the size and
appearance of a horse's tail.  Those in most
common use, were of a reddish colour; but a few of
them were white.  The bark of which they are
made is taken from a long running vine.  The
boys go quite naked until they are ten or twelve
years old, when a dress similar to that of the men
is put on them.  Their ornaments consist of shell
bracelets and necklaces, and sometimes a string
of thorn is put round the head; flowers, when
they can be obtained, are often used instead of
shells.  Many of the men, and some of the women
have large slits in their ears, through which they
put rolls of leaves from one to two inches in
diameter.  The women wear beautiful white straw
mats, of elegant workmanship, about two feet
square, and sometimes larger, bordered round the
edge, from one to two inches, with black diamond
figures, worked in with coloured straw, died with
the husk of the cocoa-nut.  They usually wear
two of these mats, one of which is behind and the
other before, tied round the waist with a beautiful
round cord of braided straw.  The ornaments of the
women are the same as those worn by the men.
They have no manner of worship.  They
acknowledge the existence of a Great Spirit whom
they call Kenneet, and who, they say, can make
them sick and kill them: they look for nothing
good from him, and, so far as I could learn, have
no idea of rewards and punishments after death.
They have a sort of conjurers amongst them,
for whose art they entertain great reverence,
and in whom they place a strict reliance.  To
them they apply in all cases of great emergency.
Their art consists in having a large bunch of
straws, which they fold double and tie in a great
many different ways; if, after the straws are thus
folded, doubled, and tied, they can be drawn out
without being in any manner entangled the one
with the other, the omen is propitious; but otherwise,
the contemplated undertaking is relinquished.
On the following morning it is again resorted
to, and so on until success is promised.  It
must never be tried but in the morning, and only
once on the same day.  The morning I took Lay
from the natives, the chiefs had recourse to this
art before they would allow him to speak to us;
they were promised good fortune, otherwise he
would have been concealed from us.  He who
cannot perform the mysteries of this art, is not
allowed to drink from the same cup with him who can.
</p>

<p>
They had a great aversion to hearing us whistle,
particularly in their houses, and would
invariably run up to any of our people when they
were whistling, and with a fearful look, beg them
to stop; saying, it would bring spirits about the
house that would make them sick and kill them.
If one of them has wronged another who has died,
or if they were enemies, he never eats without
throwing away a portion[<a id="chap01fn13text"></a><a href="#chap01fn13">13</a>] of his food to appease
the ghost of the departed.
</p>

<p>
At a meeting we had with the chiefs on shore,
the captain remarked an old man in the circle,
whose name and character he asked of Lay or
Huzzy; being replied to, he said, in a stern
manner that he did not like his face, meaning that
he looked like a bad man.  The old fellow, seeing
himself the subject of conversation, asked the
interpreter what the captain was saying about
him.  On being told, his countenance expressed
the utmost dismay, and in a day or two afterwards,
he died.  There was not a native on the
islands with whom Lay or Huzzy conversed, that
did not believe the captain's dislike killed the old
man.  They seemed to entertain the most singular
notions of the captain's supernatural powers.
</p>

<p>
For the purpose of ascertaining what idea the
high chief entertained of a God, the captain asked
him several questions, to which his answers were
vague and unsatisfactory.  He thought he had
conceived the right one, when he asked the chief
who he thought made it thunder.  After a moment's
hesitation, he looked at the captain and
replied, "I suppose you can make it thunder."  This
was as satisfactory as any thing he could be
made to express.  Thunder he believed was
produced by the agency of a being superior to himself,
and the captain he conceived to be infinitely his superior.

Not long after the massacre of the white men,
the natives were visited by a disease that caused
their limbs to swell, and produced great distress
amongst them; it was before unknown, and they
ascribed it to Lay and Huzzy, who, they believed,
had the power to afflict them in that manner, and
had done it to be revenged for the death of their
countrymen.  They finally charged them with it,
and threatened to kill them, which, in all
probability they would have done, but for their
superstitious fear of some greater evil.
</p>

<p>
Their huts are not, generally, more than ten by
fifteen feet, and from ten to fifteen feet high.
They are divided into two apartments, upper and
lower; the lower is open all round, without any
thatching; the floor is raised a little above the
adjacent ground, and covered over with small
pieces of the cleanest and whitest coral that can
be found.  The rafters and small sticks that are
laid across them for the thatching, are secured by
twine made from the outer husk of cocoa-nut, with
which the thatching is also secured.  The thatch
is the leaves of palm or cocoa-nut.  The ceiling
of the lower room is generally so low, that one
must bend almost double to get into it, and if you
remain, it must be in a lying or sitting posture.
The garret has a floor of sticks thickly interwoven
with leaves; it is higher than the ground
floor, and has an air of comfort.  The natives
keep their provisions in it, and all such things as
they would preserve from the rats.  They also
sleep there in wet weather.  In the floor, a hole
is left just large enough for a person to crawl
through, and so far from the sides that the rats
cannot get to it.
</p>

<p>
Their canoes display the greatest ingenuity,
and I have no doubt, that in a civilized country,
they would be ranked amongst the rarest specimens
of human industry, unassisted but by the
rudest implements.  The model is most singular,
and differs from all that I have ever seen in use,
either in the European or American world.  Its
construction is so remarkable, and in many
respects so inconvenient, that it seems improbable
the model should have had its origin in any other
cause than the want of suitable timber for a more
perfect structure.  The depth of a Mulgrave canoe,
of common size, is four or five feet; its length
from thirty to forty.  It is so narrow that a man
can scarcely stand in it; perfectly flat on one
side, and round on the other.  It is sharp at both
ends.  The mast is from twelve to twenty-five
feet long, and the sail, (a straw mat,) which is
bent to a small yard, is very large in proportion
to the canoe.  They always sail on the flat side,
and have the mast a little inclined forward.  It is
supported by shrouds and a guy at either end,
which is used at pleasure to give the mast its
proper inclination.  In beating to windward, instead
of tacking as we do, and presenting the other side
of the boat to the wind, they bring the other end
of the boat to it, making that the bow which was
before the stern.  Amidships there are several
light spars extending about ten feet over the round
side, and four over the other.  Across these are
smaller sticks, which are securely lashed above
and below, and over them is made a platform.
Upon that part of it which extends over the flat
side, they have a small thatched cabin, in which
they store whatever they wish to preserve from
getting wet, or would conceal from observation.
The other part of the platform is intended to keep
the canoe from being upset; and when hard pressed
with carrying sail, several men will sometimes
get on it, to keep the canoe upright.  They move
through the water with astonishing velocity, and,
in turning to windward, no boats can surpass
them.  Although the natives had no other tools
to work with than what they made of shells,
previous to the visit of the Globe, every article of
their workmanship is neat, and as highly polished
as though it had been wrought with steel.  In the
construction of their canoes, the keel-stern and
sternpost are solid pieces of hard wood, upon which
they are built up of small pieces laid one above the
other, and closely seized on with the line of
cocoa-husk.  The seams are neither caulked or
payed, and the canoe consequently leaks so much as
to require one man to bail constantly.  The
steerage is very laborious; they have no rudder, and
the only means by which they steer, is with a
long flat paddle held in the hands of the helmsman.
To steer a large canoe in blowing weather,
requires the utmost strength of six or eight men.
Upon the outriggers or platforms, and along the
masts, they arrange their spears, which are
always taken with them, even upon the most
ordinary occasions.  The canoes are also always
ballasted with a quantity of round stones, weighing
about a pound each, which forms a material part
of their armament.  Our carpenter was several
days at work upon the canoe of the high chief,
caulking and graving her.  When he had completed
his work, the high chief, after expressing
his gratification, earnestly solicited the captain to
leave him on the island; he said that he would
always provide him an abundance to eat, and that
no one should ever hurt him.  This, according to
the high chief's standard, was the most ample
reward that he could promise for useful services.
</p>

<p>
The people of the Mulgraves are in general of
moderate stature, and well made.  Their complexion
is not so dark as that of the natives of the
Duke of Clarence and Byron's Island, and their
features more comely.  They appeared to us
like a different race of men.  They have not the
flat noses and thick lips of the low islanders,
except that two or three persons we saw would
come under that description.  Their hair is long
and invariably combed out with great neatness,
and tied on the top of their heads.  Their
deportment is modest and manly, and after one
becomes a little accustomed to their dress, they have
always an air of gentility.  They have a fine
majestic walk, which one would hardly suppose,
when it is considered that their way is everywhere
paved with sharp coral.
</p>

<p>
After we had given them the pigs, it was amusing
to see with what apparent pleasure they carried
them about in their arms, nursing them with
as much care and tenderness, as though they had
been children, whilst the pigs, unused to such
treatment, were kicking and scratching the naked
bodies of the poor natives, and squealing away
most lustily.  We had to interfere to keep the
pigs from being killed with kindness, and finally
prevailed upon the chief to forbid their being
petted in this style.  It is not improbable that, in a
few years, the whalers that may have occasion
to cruise, in the vicinity of these islands, will find
an abundant supply.  It is hoped, however, that
until they become numerous, no navigator who
may chance to touch there, will encourage the
natives to diminish their number.
</p>

<p>
At 4, A.M., on the 9th of December, we took
our departure from the Mulgrave Islands, and
stood to the westward.  At daylight, we had lost
sight of the group, and at 10, A.M., made South
Pedder's Island.  Having stood a little too far to
the southward, we were all day beating up to
weather the N.E. point, where, at sun-down, we
hove to in the hope that on the following morning
we should be able to effect a landing, and get a
sight of the great chief, so celebrated amongst the
people we had just left.  On the 11th of December,
having passed all the early part of the day
searching in vain for anchorage, we hove to, a
little after meridian, opposite to a considerable
bay, upon the shore of which was a native village,
and large forests of cocoa-nut trees.  The captain
took Huzzy in the gig, and, followed by another
boat, pulled in over a wide coral bank to the
village.  A few people were attracted to the shore
by the appearance of our boats.  They immediately
conducted the captain to the chief, who
was seated on a mat in the open air, in front of
his hut.  He seemed but little moved at the
unexpected appearance of his visitors.  He was a
very old man, and had a long white beard that
came down upon his breast.  The natives stood
round in respectful silence, as the old chief
addressed the captain, whom he soon distinguished
as the person of highest rank amongst the strangers.
He spoke the same language as the inhabitants
of the Mulgraves, and Huzzy was forbidden
to let him know that he was understood, but to
listen attentively to what he was saying to those
around him.  For a time his intercourse with the
captain was carried on by signs, and Huzzy
overheard him say to the natives, standing by, "Don't
disturb them yet.  Wait until to-morrow, and see
what they are going to do.  They will look round
here to see what they can find, trade a little, and
go on board of their vessel, to sleep, and
to-morrow they will come again."  When the captain
told Huzzy to address some questions to the
chief in his own language, it seemed to operate as
quickly as an electric shock upon the natives,
who stared wildly around at him, and at each
other, with looks of the utmost astonishment.  The
chief partially lost his gravity in the sensation it
produced, being not less surprised than his
subjects.  He asked Huzzy, before answering the
question put to him, where he had learned to
speak the language of Pedder's Island.  Huzzy
replied, that he had learned it at the Mulgrave
Islands, where he had been for two years.  The
old chief said, that he had been informed of two
white men being there, and was then fitting out a
fleet of canoes to send after them.  He expressed
a great deal of disappointment, that we had taken
them away, saying, he would have had them
brought to his own island, and treated them well.
He asked, if Lay was also on board of the vessel.
The captain had taken on shore a present for the
chief, and a number of trifles, that he thought
might be acceptable to the natives.  Our people
endeavoured to obtain a quantity of cocoa-nuts
and bup, of which there was the greatest abundance;
but the natives parted with their fruit
very reluctantly.  When finally the captain
addressed the chief, upon the subject of giving or
selling us a supply, he said,&mdash;No! that his island
was thickly inhabited, and produced no more food
than was necessary for his people.  That, if we
were in want of cocoa-nuts and bup, there were
other islands, not far to the westward, where there
was an abundance, and but few people, and he
advised our going there as speedily as possible.
Upon being asked, if he had ever seen white men
before, he replied,&mdash;Yes; that a long time ago
there came a large vessel, in which there were
white men, who brought their forge on shore,
where they remained for several days.  This, he
said, was the only instance.  The young women
were all sent away, and concealed in the thickets,
or upon a distant part of the island, where they
remained during the whole day.
</p>

<p>
Amongst other presents made by the captain to
the high chief, was a battle-axe,&mdash;to him an
article of the greatest value.  He received it,
however, with reluctance, expressing his regret, that
he had it not in his power to make a suitable return
for so valuable a consideration, accompanying his
apology with a small present of mats, cocoa-nuts,
and a preparation of the ripe bup, that had an
agreeable sweet taste.  It was after dark when
our party left the village, and went to the beach
to embark.  They had already left the shore a
few yards, when some natives came running down,
and called for them to return, saying, the chief
had another mat for the captain.  They landed,
when they were told, that the mat was in the
village, and that Huzzy must go for it.  The
captain, not choosing to send for the mat, put off
again.  In a few moments two or three other
messengers came running to the beach, calling for
the boat to return.  When she had pulled in a
few yards from the shore, they said that the chief
wanted Huzzy to go up to the village for the mat,
and that he did not wish to keep the axe, which he
had sent back to the captain, unwilling, as we
supposed, to lay himself under so great an
obligation as its acceptance implied.  The captain
refused to take the axe, telling the messenger to
say to his chief, that what we had given, we never
took back, and, with this, left the shore and
returned on board.  The tide had risen considerably
over the coral bank, and the party found the surf
somewhat dangerous in returning, having their
boats nearly filled with water.
</p>

<p>
The dress and general appearance of these
people, as well as their language, was the same
as that of the natives of the Mulgraves.  Their
canoes were also the same.  We saw only three
or four with sails, which were hauled upon the
beach.  The power of the great chief must,
therefore, consist in his dominion over other
islands to the northward and westward of him,
where there is an almost connected chain for
several hundred miles, and from which, when he
undertakes an important enterprise, he must, in a
great measure, draw his resources.  It was probably
with the object of collecting forces for the
great chief, that Latuano visited so many islands
during his exile from his own, and to which he
was at last restored by foreign aid.
</p>

<p>
At eight in the evening, we made sail to the
northward and westward, with a fresh breeze from
the eastward.  The weather was clear, and we
stood on under easy sail all night.  Early in the
morning land was discovered, bearing nearly
west, and soon afterwards more land was seen to
the north.  The last was Ibbitson's Island, and
appeared to be separate from that discovered first.
It is not improbable, however, that they are
connected by coral reefs, that were too distant from
us to be observed.
</p>

<p>
The land was all low, and had the appearance
of the Mulgraves and other coral islands.  At
meridian, we hove to, and put off in two boats.
Having passed to leeward of the island, we
crossed a drowned reef, that extended as far as
the eye could reach to the N.W., when we found
ourselves in an inland sea, which was extensive
and quite smooth.  That part of the island where
we landed was about five miles long, and a
quarter of a mile wide.  Upon the margin of the
inland sea, there were a number of huts, but when
we landed, not an inhabitant could be seen.  The
huts had evidently been but recently occupied.
The island was covered abundantly with cocoa-nut
and bup trees, and a few of the bread-fruit
were here and there to be seen.  On the shore of
the inland sea the water was smooth and unruffled,
and the humble but neat dwellings of the
natives, scattered about amongst the cocoa
forests, presented a scene of quiet and repose,
peculiarly soothing to the mind, contrasted with
the eternal war of breakers on the ocean side.
We had not been long on shore before we found a
few old people, who had concealed themselves in
the bushes, and, although they were at first afraid
of us, they became less timid, and increased in
number, when we had presented them with some
pieces of iron, and a few old buttons.  In return,
they gave us mats, fishing-nets, cocoa-nuts, and
bup, with the last of which they filled our boat.
Their dress and language was the same as at the
Mulgraves, and their habitations and canoes were
also the same.  Amongst all these islands, the
natives ascend the cocoa-nut trees, in the way I
have described at the Marquesas.  Here we saw
several very old people, some of whom had lost
all their teeth,&mdash;a circumstance we had not before
remarked in any of these islands.  There were
also two or three cripples, who were not less
remarkable, being the first we had seen.  All the
females were very old, and, upon inquiring the
cause, they replied, that the young men had sent
the young women away, for fear they would be
given presents.  Two or three large sail canoes
came from a great distance over the inland sea,
and approached us without fear.  The natives
told us that they had never seen white men before.
</p>

<p>
The captain landed upon a different island from
myself, and the natives, having fled from their
habitations as they did upon the island where I
landed, he sent a few old people, that were found,
commanding all the inhabitants to return to their
homes, and, fearing his displeasure, in a few
minutes their huts were occupied in the same
manner as though the white-faced strangers had
not appeared amongst them.
</p>

<p>
At five, P.M., we returned to the schooner,
with our boats laden with fruit, and soon afterwards
made sail, shaping our course for the Sandwich
Islands.  We were favoured with south
easterly trades, blowing in fresh gales for a
number of days, which rendered our passage
materially shorter than it would probably have been
otherwise.  But what was still less to have been
expected than a south-east trade in the northern
tropic, was a strong current, that set us at the
rate of thirty to forty miles a day, N.E. from
the latitude of sixteen to twenty-five north.
Part of the time that we experienced this strong
current, the wind was blowing a double-reefed
top-sail breeze from East and E.N.E., differing
only from two to four points with the opposite
direction of the current.  When we arrived in
the latitude of twenty-three degrees north, the
trades left us, and the winds became variable.  At
meridian of December the 24th, we were, by our
calculation, thirty miles from an island, said to
have been discovered recently by a whaler, and
which we made to bear from us E. by N.  Our
latitude observed was twenty-five degrees
fifty-seven minutes, N. Longitude, by chronometer,
one hundred and eighty-six degrees twenty-seven
minutes, W.  We ran off to the eastward all the
following day, and at meridian, December 25th,
observed, in latitude twenty-six degrees, N.;
longitude one hundred and eighty-three degrees
twenty minutes W., without having seen the
slightest indications of land.
</p>

<p>
On Christmas day, we gave the crew a dinner
of turtle, which were still fat, and very delicious.
We had fed them occasionally upon bup and other
vegetation, that was found upon the islands.
</p>

<p>
December the 27th, we came within the vicinity
of another new discovery of a whaler, and at
meridian, had it bearing, by our calculation,
S.E. ten miles.  We ran for it until six, P.M.,
December 28th, when no appearance of land being
in sight, we hove about, and stood to the northward,
for a newly discovered reef, which, at meridian,
bore from us, by calculation N. by E.,
distant one hundred miles.  Latitude observed,
twenty-six degrees ten minutes N.; longitude, by
chronometer, one hundred and seventy-six degrees
fifty-one minutes, W.  The reef for which we
were now steering was called, by the discoverer,
Clark's Reef.  It was said to extend sixty miles,
in a south-west and north-easterly direction, and
we thought it impossible that it should escape our
observation, if laid down any where near the given
latitude and longitude.
</p>

<p>
At nine, P.M., December the 30th, we were
within twenty-five miles of the centre of the reef,
by our calculation, and as it was blowing a gale,
and we were scudding before it with an unusually
high sea, we hove to for the night.  At three,
A.M., we again made sail, and ran for the centre
of the reef.  At meridian, December the 31st, the
centre of it was still twenty miles from us,
bearing N. E. by N.  From meridian to one, P.M.,
we steered N. by E., and then bore up, and
steered east all the rest of the twenty-four hours,
without seeing the reef or any indications of it.  At
meridian, observed, in latitude twenty-six degrees
forty-seven minutes, N.; longitude, by chronometer,
one hundred and seventy-two degrees eleven minutes, W.
</p>

<p>
We continued on to the eastward, with the hope
of falling in with two islands and a reef, of another
whaler's discovery.  Our confidence in their
given latitude and longitude, however, was quite
destroyed by frequent disappointments, and we
now looked for their discoveries, as we would
have sought for lands, known only in the tradition
of the natives of some unfrequented island,
with the hope of finding them, but with little
expectation of success.  It happened with these, as
with all the rest of the new discoveries we had
looked for.  We passed within a few miles of the
latitude, and ran down from one to two degrees of
longitude, without observing any thing that
indicated the vicinity of land.
</p>

<p>
On the second of January, 1826, we ran off to
the southward of east for Ballard's Island.
During the middle of the day, the sea, from being very
heavy, became comparatively smooth, and continued
so for sixty miles, when the heavy swell
again set in from the westward, as before.
</p>

<p>
At three, P.M., on the fourth of January, a
rock was reported from the mast-head, eight
leagues from us.  It proved to be Ballard's Island,
as it is called.  At eight on the following
morning, we passed within two hundred yards of it.
It is about two or three hundred yards in
circumference, and rises two hundred feet from the sea.
On one side it has a considerable inclination, where
seals had crawled up, and several were basking
in the sun, almost to the very top.  Large flocks
of birds were perched upon its ragged sides, or
wending their flight around it.  Not the least
sign of vegetation was any where to be seen.
Near its base, was a small rock, from ten to twenty
feet above the water level.  Ballard's Rock rises
in three equi-distant peaks, the centre of which is
the highest, and all of them, to the very base, are
white with bird-lime.  A high surf breaks all around
it.  Our observations placed it in north latitude,
twenty-five degrees two minuses; west longitude,
one hundred and sixty-seven degrees fifty minutes.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of January the fifth, the
weather became squally, with constant flashes of
lightning and distant thunder.  From south to
west, and N.W., the heavens were obscured with
a heavy black cloud, which rose with great
rapidity.  We furled all sail.  When the cloud
ascended our zenith, it became perfectly calm,
and a roaring was heard in the air for several
minutes, like that of wind through the tops of pines,
when hail-stones of an unusual size began to fall
upon our deck, accompanied with very sharp
lightning and heavy thunder.  The hail was of
short duration, and passed over without a breath
of wind.
</p>

<p>
The nearest of the Sandwich Group was Bird
Island, for which we steered, and on the ninth of
January, at eight in the morning (having the
preceding night been enveloped in fog) it was
discovered close to us.  We tacked and stood
close in with the south-west side, where
was a small sand-beach, fifty to a hundred yards
long.
</p>

<p>
The captain, taking the Globe's whale-boat,
went in shore to fish, but seeing a few seal upon
the sand beach, was induced to land.  It soon
afterwards became squally and blew with great
violence.  The surf upon the beach rose with the
wind, and, when the captain, after a short examination
of the island, attempted to return, he found
it impossible to launch his boat through the surf,
and was reduced to the necessity of passing the
night upon the island.  It blew a gale and rained
in torrents all night.  The captain and his boat's
crew took shelter in a cavern upon the sea-shore,
where they had not been long by a comfortable
fire they had made, when, by the rising of the tide
the sea broke in upon them, and they with difficulty
escaped to the side of the rocks, and thence
upon the sand-beach.  The island was high and
almost perpendicular, and with the floods that fell
and rushed down its steep sides, rocks of a large
size were disengaged from their beds, and came
tumbling down in every direction, to the great
peril of the captain and his boat's crew, sufficiently
uncomfortable from the torrents of water that
were falling and driving upon the gale.  After
a little search, they found an asylum in a cave at
the side of a mountain, where they passed the
night.  In the morning, when they ascended the
mountain, the schooner was no where to be seen.
It was high and steep, and she had beat up within
a few miles of the island and passed their line of
sight.  Their disappointment and chagrin was
inexpressible, supposing, from the schooner's not
being in sight, she had been driven off, and that it
would be a considerable time before she could
return, and afford them that relief their situation so
much required, being very much fatigued and
exhausted from their exposure.  At day-light, the
weather cleared and the wind moderated.  We
beat up and hove to off the sand-beach nearly as
soon as the boat we had sent with refreshments.
</p>

<p>
When the captain saw the schooner approaching
close in with the island, he made a last effort
to launch his boat.  They succeeded in getting her
into the breakers, but the first heavy roller that
broke under them severed the boat amid-ships, and
the captain upon one end of her and a man that
could not swim on the other, were hove up safely
on the beach by the succeeding wave.  The rest
of the boat's crew were good swimmers, and also
landed in safety.  Our boat was not far off when
this occurred, and anchoring as near as possible to
the shore, the men, all but one, swam off to her
through the surf.  The only way we could devise
to get the captain and seaman off, was to float
a cork-jacket on shore, at the end of a line, which
being put on by the captain and seaman, alternately,
and a rope tied round them, they were
hauled through the surf without any other injury
than swallowing a quantity of salt-water.
</p>

<p>
Bird's Island is an uninhabited rock, about a
league in circumference, and the highest part
from five to eight hundred feet above the ocean.
Where our boat landed, is the only spot where a
landing could be effected, and upon that side alone
it has an inclination by which it may be ascended.
Every where else it is perpendicular, and at a
distance, looks like the work of art.  It has a
scanty vegetation.
</p>

<p>
At five, P.M., January the 11th, we made sail
for the island of Oahoo, with a fine breeze from
the westward and pleasant weather.  At daylight,
on the following morning, we saw the small
island of Onehow, and soon afterwards, the
highland of Atooi.  During the whole day, we were
coming up with and sailing along on the west
side of Atooi, moving at the rate of eight and
nine miles per hour.  Of a clear day, it may be
seen at least fifty or sixty miles.  We did not
approach nearer to it than eight or ten.  It had the
appearance, at that distance, of beautiful
table-land, being every where very regular and of
nearly the same altitude.  Towards evening, on
the 12th of January, we made the island of Oahoo,
and should have been at anchor in Onavoora on
the following day had we passed between Atooi and
Oahoo, but from some mistake about the prevailing
winds on the opposite side of Oahoo, we continued
on round the north end of it, and did not
anchor at Onavoora until the sixteenth.  Two or
three American merchant vessels were lying
there, with which we exchanged salutes.  The
Dolphin was the first American man-of-war that
ever entered a harbour of the Sandwich Islands,
and the firing of the guns, and the report widely
circulated that an American man-of-war had
arrived, brought the inhabitants from far and near
to the shore of the harbour to witness the novel
sight.  Several of our countrymen, who were
traders here, and had been expecting us for some
time, came on board to offer their congratulations,
and invite us on shore to partake of their hospitality.
It was highly gratifying to us upon landing,
to meet nearly all of our countrymen residing at
the Island, who came down, en masse, to the
beach, to welcome us on shore, in the most kind
and friendly manner.  We were a little
disappointed, however, when we came to look round
and found that none of the missionaries had
partaken in the general sentiment.  They were also
our countrymen, and from the character of
benevolence and philanthropy they had assumed to
themselves, we had a right to expect they would
have been amongst the first to hail us with a
welcome to their lonely abode.  We expected,
indeed, that they would not only have received us
as countrymen, but as friends, whose kindness,
and sympathy would be highly acceptable to them
in their peculiar situation.
</p>

<p>
From the shore we were escorted to a large
frame building called the wooden-house, then
occupied by our countryman, Captain Wilds, where
a handsome dinner was prepared, to which every
luxury was added that could be obtained from the
shipping or the shore.  We were much surprised
on landing, to find a rabble of naked and
half-naked natives, amounting to many hundreds, as
we had been taught to believe, from the various
information we had received, that their
condition was much improved, and that they were
far advanced in civilization.  They were of all
ages, and formed a more varied and fantastic
group than I had any where seen, even where no
degree of civilization had taken place, from an
intercourse with white men.  Some of them were
quite naked; some had their native dress of tappa
cloths; some had on cotton shirts, some a pair of
old trowsers, and some nothing but an old jacket.
Many of them had adorned their heads with
wreaths of red and yellow flowers, and some their
necks and wrists with necklaces and bracelets of
shells.  They expressed the greatest pleasure at
seeing us, shouting and crowding around, so that
we could not get along without pushing them out
of the way.  In appearance, a comparison of them
with the natives of the Marquesas or Mulgrave
Islands, would have been greatly to their
disadvantage.  On the following day, we were again
invited to dine at the same place, where we met a
second time with our countrymen, and interchanged
with them those sentiments of friendship and
sympathy that naturally arise on meeting in a
strange land, and which are felt by Americans
with peculiar force.  It appeared to us that they
could not sufficiently express their gratification at
seeing us at Oahoo, by the most unremitted attention,
for they continued to feast and give us parties
every day for more than a week, and until our
various and pressing duties made it inconvenient
for us to partake of them.  On the first sabbath
after our arrival, I went to the place of worship
appointed by the missionaries for the natives.  A
large building, formerly occupied for this purpose,
had been destroyed a short time previous to our
arrival, and as they had now no house sufficiently
large to contain the whole congregation, the
place appointed for worship was an extensive
enclosure in the rear of a large frame building, which
is occupied as the dwelling of the young king.
Within this enclosure, was assembled about a
thousand people, as I supposed, seated on the
ground.  Some of them were dressed in silks,
cottons, and calicoes, and others were in their
native dress, being quite naked, except about the
waist.  They were in the open air, without any
protection from the sun, which was pouring its
vertical rays upon them.  Mr. Bingham, the
head of the mission, was addressing them in the
language of the island, and when he saw me at
the outer edge of the circle, very kindly beckoned
me to come round where the queen dowager was
seated.  He was standing there himself.  A
native was holding an umbrella over his head, and
around him were seated all the chief men and
women, some in chairs, and some of them on the
ground.  With one or two exceptions, they were
all people of uncommon size.  Some of them were
quite neatly dressed, but others had displayed a
most whimsical and ridiculous fancy.  When I
came near Cahumanu, who was the favourite wife
of the departed and highly distinguished
Tamahamaha, she extended her hand to me and bade
one of her attendants bring me a chair.  The
service lasted about an hour, when the assemblage
dispersed, and the natives ran away as much
pleased as so many children let loose from school.
At the close of the service, I promised myself so
much politeness on the part of the distinguished
personages present, as to receive from some of
them an invitation to go into their houses, as I was
in the uniform of a foreign officer; but in this I
was altogether disappointed.  I had the satisfaction
of speaking, for a few minutes, with Mr. Bingham,
whose attention was soon called from
me by the presence of some chief, with whom he
wished to exchange a salutation, and after
recognizing two or three of the chiefs present whom I
had seen before, I was suffered to depart without
receiving any further notice.
</p>

<p>
On Monday, I made a call of ceremony on the
high chief Boque, who was one of the attendants
of the late king Rio Rio, on his visit to the king
of England.  He was a man of about thirty years
of age, upwards of six feet, and stout in
proportion.  He had a flat nose and thick lips, but the
general expression of his face was that of benevolence
and good nature&mdash;an expression truly characteristic,
according to the testimony of those who
have had an opportunity of knowing him well.
We found him sitting in a chair at a table, with a
desk before him, upon which he was making
pot-hooks after a copy, having just commenced
learning to write.  He got up and shook hands
with us, as did also his wife, who was seated on
some mats at the other end of the hut.  Boque
was dressed in a coarse linen shirt and trowsers,
having a pair of heavy shoes on his feet, without
any stockings.  Queen Boque was nearly as
large as her husband, and looked a good deal like
him.  She had on a plain white muslin cap and
dress, neither of which were very clean or neatly
put on.  It was, however, in as good taste as
could be expected in so rude a state of society,
but I thought it less becoming than would have
been her native dress.  She invited us to be
seated, and made an attempt at politeness, such as she
had seen practised in England, having accompanied
her husband thither.  The hut was an oblong
building, about sixty by forty feet.  Its
simple structure was the same that has been in use
in the islands from time immemorial, being poles
laid over crotches, upon which the rafters rested,
and differing in nothing from the habitations of
the poorest people, except that the crotches, poles,
and rafters, were longer, and there were more of
them.  It was thatched from the top all the way
to the ground, with a thick covering of grass.  The
interior was all in one apartment, from the top of
the rafters to the hard beaten ground floor.  There
was nothing ornamental, and no superfluous
furniture.  A bedstead standing in one corner, with
some pieces of white tappa cloth of the island for
curtains, whereon was laid a pile of mats for a
bed; two or three piles of mats laying along near
the centre of the hut, raised one or two feet from
the floor, by being piled one above the other, for
beds or lounging places; two or three old chairs;
a plain table of small dimensions, and a dressing-case
with a mirror in it, was all of Boque's furniture,
either useful or ornamental.  Besides these
may be mentioned a few hollow gourds for poye,
(a favourite food of the Sandwich Islanders, made
from the tarrow,) hanging at the side of the hut.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Boque's palace, we went with the
intention of making a similar call upon the high
chief Crimacu, known to strangers who have
visited the island, by the name of Billy Pitt.  He was
the high carnie, or great friend of Tamahamaha,
in whose wars he was greatly distinguished
for personal prowess, sagacity, and wisdom.
When we came to his hut, we found him sleeping
in a swinging cot, with several attendants sitting
round, one of whom was fanning him.  He was
in very ill health, having for a long time been
afflicted with the dropsy, and we departed without
waking him.  His hut differed in nothing from
that of Boque, except that it was not so large, and
had a greater profusion of mats in it.  It was
standing in one corner of an extensive plain, that
was partially enclosed by a wicker fence just at
the outskirts of the town of Onaroora, and all
around it was growing wild grass and weeds,
except where the footsteps of the people, who passed
to and from the hut, had trodden them down.  It
looked but little like the habitation of a man who
had been a great warrior, and associated as second
in authority with one who had conquered and
ruled over thousands of men.  One would
naturally suppose that in emerging from a savage
state, with absolute power, he would have made
an attempt, at least, to imitate the style and
manners of the white men with whom he was
constantly meeting, and always on terms of friendship.
</p>

<p>
After we had interchanged salutes with the
shore, chief Boque came on board on the 17th, to
make us a visit of ceremony.  He was dressed
in a splendid English major-general's uniform,
and made a very handsome appearance.  He
remained and partook of a collation with us, at which
several gentlemen were invited to meet him, and
in all respects acquitted himself in a more polite
and becoming manner than could have been
expected from one whose opportunities had been so
limited.  He drank sparingly of wine, and left us
at an early hour, notwithstanding the solicitations
of the company for him to remain.  A few hours
after he had landed, I met him again, and should
hardly have recognized him but for his large
stature and good-natured face.  He had stripped
himself of all his finery, and was walking over the
plain from his house with nothing on but his
marrow, and a piece of tappa cloth of the island thrown
loosely over his shoulders.  I asked him why he
had taken off his uniform, to which he replied,
that it was too warm.
</p>

<p>
Our countrymen, to vary the entertainments
they were constantly giving us, and thereby make
them the more acceptable, proposed that we should
make an excursion to a valley, called by them
Pearl River, from the pearl frequently found
in a small stream that passes through it.  As
horses could not be obtained for all, part of the
company went by water, whilst the rest, four
or five, mounted on horseback.  The distance was
about fifteen miles.  I made one of the land party,
and we set off early in the afternoon.  There was
no road, and in many places not even a footpath.
The whole way was over hill and dale, and
through swamps.  We had to jump fences and
ditches made through tarrow-patches, and ascend
by narrow paths, difficult and dangerous cliffs.
All the afternoon was occupied in this manner,
and it was sundown when we arrived at our place
of destination.  One old native made bold to
oppose us in jumping our horses over his fence, and
was so obstinate in his refusal to let us pass, that
for a time we thought we should have to relinquish
our excursion&mdash;a reflection not very agreeable,
after having advanced more than half way
over so wretched a road.  Finally, when all other
arguments had failed, some one of the party,
thinking that the native opposed our trespass upon
his premises with no other object than to lay us
under contribution, gave him half a dollar, which
did more for us than all our threats or persuasion.
Instead of opposing, he afterwards pointed
out to us the best way.  From Onavoora to Pearl
River, the country was thinly inhabited.  We
met with no considerable village or rich valley.
Our road lay near the edge of a wide marsh, that
intervened between us and the sea, in the opposite
direction from which, an undulating country
extended three or four miles, when it was
interrupted by the high and uninhabited range of
mountains that run through the centre of the
island from one end to the other.  It was
Saturday evening, when we arrived at Pearl River,
and, according to the doctrine in which the
missionaries had instructed the Sandwich islanders,
their sabbath had commenced.  The hut that we
were to occupy belonged to Captain Dana, an
American gentleman, to whom we were indebted
for many hours of agreeable pastime.  Besides
the hut, he possessed other property in the valley,
which gave him an influence with the chief of it,
that enabled him to command whatever it
produced.  When we arrived, the chief was seated
on a mat, near Captain Dana's hut, moody, and,
apparently, very stupid.  The arrival of so many
strangers, in a place where a visiter was scarcely
ever seen, produced a lively interest amongst the
villagers.  All of them seemed to partake of the
general excitement, but the chief, though
celebrated for his hospitality, was now sunk in the
most listless apathy, and apparently scarcely
sensible of our presence.  When he was told that we
wanted supper, and preparation made for our
accommodation on the morrow, he replied, that it
was the sabbath, and neither then nor on the
morrow could fire be made, as it was forbidden
by the Almighty.  Upon being asked how he
knew that it was forbidden by the Almighty, he
said, that Mr. Bingham had seen the Almighty,
who told him so.  This was a great check to our
promised enjoyment, and one that we were quite
unprepared for, as no prohibition of making fire
on Saturday, or any other night, was in existence
at Onavoora.  We saw but a poor prospect of
getting supper or any thing, indeed, until we
returned, unless we fasted on Sunday, and that our
religious scruples did not call for, if it were not
unavoidable.  We were unwilling, however, to
interfere with the established observances, which
had been thought necessary to civilize and
improve the condition of the people, and bore our
disappointment in silence.  After wandering about
the village for a while, which was small, and
scattered over a sterile ridge, we were relieved
from our unpleasant dilemma by a native, we had
taken with us as cook and interpreter, who was
commonly known upon the island by the name of
Joe Banks.  He had received some education, and
had been a convert to the missionaries, from
whom he afterwards seceded.  He did not like
fasting any more than ourselves, and set about
haranguing the chief, to convince him of the
error of his opinion, with respect to the making
of fire.  Joe was not wanting in either talent or
volubility; and, to our great satisfaction, we soon
found him on good terms with the chief; a fire
was made, and soon after a kid and a pig brought
up for slaughter.  I observed, that the chief's
skin was very rough and in scales, resembling
somewhat the shell of a small terrapin.  Upon
inquiring the cause, they told me, it was the effect
of the ava-root, of which he was undergoing a
course.  He had almost finished the course, and
his skin was all peeling off.  It was the effect of
the ava, that made him so stupid, and under its
operation he was a most disgusting looking object.
The natives of the Sandwich Islands are very
much subject to cutaneous irruptions, which are
troublesome, and, when of long standing, often
dangerous.  To eradicate this, and some other
offensive diseases, with which they are afflicted,
they sometimes go through a course of the ava.
It is taken in quantities from a gill to half a pint,
of the juice of the green root.  It is chewed, and
the juice spit into a gourd, if intended for the use
of another person than the one who prepares it,
and is said, when taken, to deprive the person of
muscular power.  In a few moments after swallowing
the potion, he loses the use of all his
limbs.  He experiences an agreeable sensation,
and is conscious of every thing that transpires, but
without the power of speech.  He lies in this
helpless condition for several hours, when he
recovers his strength in a measure, and is left in
the condition of a man that has been very much
intoxicated.  This, to have the desired effect, is
repeated daily for about a month; when the disease
is cured, the skin all comes off, and a fair
and shining one is left in its place.  When once
it was settled between Joe Banks and the chief of
Pearl River Valley, that fire should be made, and
our supper cooked, he provided for us in the most
sumptuous native style.  We had pigs, goats, fish,
tarrow, and potatoes, in the greatest profusion.
All was cooked after the manner of the natives,
and as the same method is practised generally
amongst the islanders of the Pacific Ocean, and
knowing, from experience, that it is a very good
one, I will here describe it.  A hole is first dug a
foot or two deep, and large, according to the size
of the thing to be cooked.  A fire is then made
in the hole, and, when it is burning well, covered
over with stones of a convenient size.  When
every thing is in readiness, the stones being well
heated, they are taken off, and the hole cleared
out.  A layer of stones is then placed all round
the interior, upon which is lain the meat, after
being well wrapped up in green leaves.  Over
this is placed a thick layer of stones, which is
covered with grass, or something dry, and then
with earth.  If vegetables are to be cooked, they
are lain on the top of the upper layer of stones.
The young tops of the tarrow are usually wrapped
up in leaves, and cooked with the meats in the
manner above described.  It is a very excellent
green, and called by the natives lewoca, from
which the method of cooking takes its name.
Early in the morning after our arrival, we arose,
to look upon the wild beauty of the valley, and
wander through what, at a distance, appeared to
be its meadows and lawns; but, to our great
disappointment, in descending from the hills, the
green level fields that looked so pleasant at a
distance, were all cut up in tarrow patches,
flooded over, and intersected in every direction with
ditches and embankments.  A scene, so uninviting,
soon induced us to relinquish our anticipated
pleasure, and return.
</p>

<p>
In the course of our morning's walk we came
to the house of an Englishman, who, a few years
previous, arrived at the island in a Peruvian
man-of-war, the seamen of which had risen upon their
officers, and ran away with the vessel.  He had
taken to himself a native wife, and, to all
appearance, had fixed here his abode for life.  His hut
looked extremely comfortable&mdash;not less so, indeed,
than that of the chief, and besides other property
that he had acquired, he had a fine flock of sheep
feeding near his residence.  He politely invited
us into his house, which we declined, as we were
returning late to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast we set off in our boat to visit a
small island near the sea shore, where there were
a great many rabbits.  We passed along several
miles of an inlet of the sea, before we came to it.
It was half a mile long, level, and overgrown
with high weeds.  The rabbits were so numerous,
that the island was every where perforated with
their burrows, and one or more would be found
in almost every bunch of high grass that we came
to,&mdash;so tame, that we could frequently take them
up in our hands.  We caught more than a dozen
of them in this way, in the short time that we
remained.  Some years previous, an old Spaniard,
by the name of Menini, who had settled at
Onavoora, put one or more pairs of rabbits upon this
small island, and prevailed upon the chiefs to
tabboo them.  From that time they had not been
disturbed.
</p>

<p>
After returning to our dinner, we all set off on
our way back to Onuvoora.  To vary the scene,
I relinquished my horse and took passage in the
boat.  We sailed for several miles among marshes
and barren islands, upon a salt water inlet, up
which a ship of heavy burthen might pass for a
considerable distance.  The whole way was quite
void of interest.  When we got to the sea, we
had a head wind to row against all the way.  A
reef extended out from the shore, beyond which
we were compelled to go, making the distance
so great, that the evening was far advanced
before we got to the Dolphin.
</p>

<p>
Not long after our return from Pearl River, I
set out one day with an American gentleman, to
ascend a high and steep mountain, that rises back
of the village, which the natives, many years ago,
fortified with a few heavy pieces of cannon.  We
crossed the plain, which is a mile or a mile and a
half wide, when we came to the base of the
mountain.  It was seven or eight hundred feet high,
and from below, seemed to rise almost perpendicular
from the plain.  A winding footpath, however,
showed us that it had long and frequently
been ascended by the natives, and encouraged us
to make the attempt.  We had often to stop and
get breath, but at last accomplished our object,
by gaining the summit and entering upon a small
plain.  Here we found several huts, that were
occupied by the families of the men appointed to
guard this important post, into which we entered
to obtain leave to examine the fortification.  The
people were very friendly; they not only granted
us permission, but hospitably proffered us some
excellent melons, which were very refreshing
after our laborious ascent.  There were only three
men in the fort, one of whom, that appeared to
have the command, politely waited upon us in our
walk round.  The guns were mounted on a platform,
at the very edge of the precipice that
overlooked the harbour and town.  They were of
thirty-two pound caliber.  It must have been a
work of inconceivable labour for the natives to
get them upon this great eminence.  The carriages
and all their fixtures were very much decayed,
and totally unfit for use.  The situation is very
commanding, and notwithstanding the distance,
the battery would be formidable to an enemy in
the harbour.  From this eminence, we had an
extensive and beautiful prospect, comprehending the
valley and harbour, many miles at sea, and along
the sea-coast in either direction.  The river, that
waters the valley, broken in cataracts as it
rapidly descended to the sea, showed to its greatest
advantage, and the valley, covered with its tarrow
patches, corn, and potatoes, presented a landscape
resembling finely cultivated fields and waving
green meadows.  In front, was the thatched village
of Onavoora, the huts looking like heaps of dry
straw; beyond it, the harbour and shipping; and
still farther, at sea, a long range of white foaming
breakers.  On the extreme right, was the valley
of Pearl River, bounded by high and rugged
mountains; and to the left, the cocoa-nut groves
of Whytete and Diamond Rock, with its adjacent
sterile hills, covered with volcanic cinders.
</p>

<p>
From the top of the hill, we descended in a
different direction on our return, with a view of
passing through a part of the valley that runs far
back from the shore between the mountains,
where it appeared to be finely cultivated and well
inhabited.  We had not gone far from the fort,
when we found ourselves near the centre of what
had been the crater of a volcano, and which, from
its resemblance, has given the eminence the name
of the Punch Bowl, by which it is familiarly
known amongst foreigners.  The crater is about
a quarter or half a mile in diameter, and from one
to two hundred feet deep.  When we descended
to the valley, which was not without difficulty,
our way was every where interrupted by tarrow
patches, their ditches, and embankments.  After
crossing a small valley, we came to an elevated
piece of ground, where the natives who cultivated
the tarrow below, had built their habitations, and
around them planted groves of Banana.  It was a
fine morning, and the people of both sexes were
industriously engaged in their appropriate
occupations.  Some of the women were roasting
tarrow, and others making it up in poye.  The latter
operation was interesting to me, as I had never
seen it before.  When the tarrow is roasted, and
the skin taken off, it resembles a potatoe; it is
then put into a tray, and with a long, smooth stone,
beaten up as fine as possible, occasionally mixing
a small quantity of water with it; after it has
been beaten in this way, it is worked over a
number of times, to get all the lumps out; it then has
the appearance of a thick paste or starch.  A
soon as it foments a little and becomes slightly
acid, it is used.  When in this state, it will not
last long before it becomes very sour, and is then
considered so unwholesome, that unless the people
are very poor, it is thrown away.
</p>

<p>
After satisfying our curiosity in seeing the
women make poye, we descended the hill where
several men were preparing a tarrow patch.  It
was forty feet square, excavated a little, and an
embankment two feet high thrown up all around
it, descending with a considerable angle from the
top to the base, making it very broad at the
bottom.  The labourers had advanced thus far, and
were beating the area and inner sides of the
embankment with broad heavy paddles, going over
it a great many times.  It appeared very hard
and firm when we saw them at work; but still,
they told us, that they had to beat it a great deal
more.  When this is completed, the tops of the
tarrow that have been cut off for the purpose, are
set in the ground and lightly flooded with water;
after it has taken root and began to grow thriftily,
more water is let in upon it; the tarrow well
grown, will generally be covered with water to
the depth of one or two feet.  It is about the
size of a beet, and takes a year or more to come
to its greatest perfection.  It has clusters of broad
bright green leaves, that in shape and appearance
are a good deal like the common pond lilly.  It
is a very nutricious vegetable, and constitutes the
principal means of subsistence of the Sandwich
Islanders.
</p>

<p>
The huts of the natives were very small, and
although in the midst of cultivation and fertility,
the inhabitants seemed to be wretchedly poor.
They did not appear much more civilized than the
natives of the Marquesas; their habitations were
certainly less comfortable.  Returning to the village,
we saw a number of people scraping sticks that
looked like our elder, and preserving the inner bark.
Upon inquiring its use, they told us it was to catch
fish with.  When eaten by the fish, they come to
the top of the water and are taken out by hand.
It is said, the fish are not the worse for this.
</p>

<p>
On our arrival at Oahoo, the Dolphin was out
of repair in every respect, and it was indispensably
necessary to refit her, before we proceeded
further on our return to the coast of Chili or Peru.
Whilst the masts were out, and the vessel was
undergoing general repairs, the captain received
a letter from Captain Edwards, of the ship Loudon,
of New-York, stating that he had ran upon
a reef, on the Island of Ranai; besides a valuable
cargo, he had a large amount of specie and bullion
on board.  The chief Thunder, (chief of Ranai,)
was encouraging the natives of the island to plunder
him, and finally, that his life and treasure was
in the greatest jeopardy.  Although not incumbent
upon him as a duty, Captain Percival, with a
promptitude highly creditable to himself and the
service to which he belonged, chartered a vessel,
and with the crew of the Dolphin, and Boque, the
Governor of Oahoo, sailed on the same day that
he received the letter.  He found the situation of
Captain Edwards not less critical than he had
described it to be.  The natives had already
plundered him of a part of his cargo, and his own crew
was in a state of mutiny.  Employing the authority
of Chief Boque, and the indefatigable industry
of his own crew, Captain Percival caused the
stolen goods to be restored, and the cargo and
treasure of the Loudon to be safely landed at
Oahoo.  When all this had been accomplished,
Captain Edwards refused to pay the charter of
the vessel that was employed for his relief, in
consequence of which, a quarrel arose between
himself and Captain Percival, that eventuated in
consequences injurious and disagreeable to both
parties, and after our return home, became a subject
of judicial investigation.  By this investigation,
which was brought on at the instance of Captain
Edwards, an opportunity was afforded to Captain
Percival and the officers of the Dolphin, to
vindicate their characters, which they did, in
every instance, to the entire satisfaction of their
government and countrymen.
</p>

<p>
Whilst Captain Percival was absent at Ranai,
Captain Jackson, of the brig Harbinger, of Boston,
addressed a letter to me, stating that his
store in the village had been broken open, and
robbed of goods to a large amount, and requesting
my assistance to recover them.  The matter was
laid before the chief, Crimacu, who instituted a
search, and on the following day, sent for Captain
Jackson.  At his hut, were assembled most of
the foreigners of any respectability on the island,
and many of the natives to witness the result of
the inquiry.  Some of the thieves had already
been detected, and now stood before the chief,
who, although very ill, sat up to question them
about the robbery.  They confessed their guilt,
and in answering the questions put to them,
convicted others, who were sent for and brought in,
until the number amounted to six.  They had
shared their booty, and were sent out, with
guards, to bring it from their different places of
concealment.  It consisted, principally, of fine
calicoes and cloths, which had been put in tarrow
patches, and oil casks, and when returned, were
so damaged, as to be of but little value to the
owner.  When the chief got through with the
inquiry, and had collected all the goods that could
be found, he asked Mr. Jackson what punishment
he would have inflicted upon the offenders.
Mr. Jackson's reply was, that he wanted restitution
made for the loss he had sustained, and that he
would leave the punishment to the chief, according
to the usage of the islands.  The chief contended
that the men were all poor, and had nothing
wherewith to pay.  He said that the chiefs
were also poor, and denied the justice of compelling
them, under any circumstances, to pay for the
thefts of the people.  He offered to put the culprits
at Captain Jackson's disposal, or inflict upon
them whatever punishment he should prescribe,
according to the laws of his own country.
Captain Jackson refused to say what punishment the
men should receive, and only contended that the
chief was bound to see his property, or an
equivalent, restored to him.  The matter was, for some
hours in debate, when the chief compromised
with Captain Jackson, by promising to have a
quantity of sandal-wood collected for him within
a prescribed period.  The thieves were set at
liberty without punishment, in consequence of
which, it was surmised by some of our countrymen,
that the chiefs had been concerned in the
theft.  This, I thought, a very unjust suspicion,
as the investigation took place so publicly, that
the fact, if it had been so, could hardly have
failed to appear in the course of the inquiry.
</p>

<p>
The magnanimity of Crimacu,[<a id="chap01fn14text"></a><a href="#chap01fn14">14</a>] in promising an
equivalent for the damaged goods, which he was
not bound to do by the customs of the Sandwich
Islands, or the laws of civilized communities, gave
me the highest opinion of his character.  It
appeared to me that he first objected to remunerate
the merchant for his loss, with no other motive
than to produce discussion, from which he might
learn what would be done in more enlightened
countries, in a similar case.  He was told of the
different punishments that the culprits would be
subject to under the laws of America and
England, but nothing could be advanced, even
supposing that he was to act in accordance with the
laws of those countries, to prove that the chiefs
or king of the islands, were in any other way
responsible for the thefts committed by individuals,
than to make them stand forth and suffer in
person for their offences.  He remarked, that the
information he received from individuals of the
same country, with respect to their laws and
customs, was often at variance, and so contradictory,
that he was frequently at a loss to know what he
should do to answer the ends of justice, and give
satisfaction to the strangers who came to the
islands.  He declared, that the chiefs of the
Sandwich Islands, wished to do like other people.
</p>

<p>
Amongst those with whom we held frequent
and friendly intercourse, was an Englishman, by
the name of Wilkinson, who had taken passage to
the Sandwich Islands, in the Frigate Blonde,
when she went there with the remains of king
Rio Rio, and who had banished himself from his
own country to this distant region, with a view of
becoming a planter of the Sandwich Islands.  He
had been, according to his own statement, a
planter in the West Indies in early life, and
subsequently on his return to England, joined a troop
of horse, of which he was a captain, destined for
Spain, during the war in the Peninsula, where he
served for a considerable time, but at the close of
the war, having left the army, and met with a
reverse of fortune, he had determined to make the
experiment in which he was now engaged.  A bold
one, it must be confessed, for a man, at the age
of forty-five, and with an enfeebled constitution.
Aided by Captain Byron, (who, from his high
rank, and the flattering mission upon which he
had been sent, was well prepared to assist him,)
Mr. Wilkinson obtained from the chiefs the first
deed that ever was granted by them, for two
hundred acres of land.  It was situated about six
miles from Onavoora, on elevated ground, bordering
upon a narrow valley that winds through the
mountains for several miles back from the sea.
The chiefs granted the deed with great
reluctance, notwithstanding the respectable source
from which the petition came, being extremely
tenacious of that command and sovereignty of the
soil, that enables them, at pleasure, to dispossess
the occupant.  They the more willingly
relinquished the spot that Mr. Wilkinson had fixed
upon for his residence, as it was situated upon
land so high, that it could not be used for the
culture of tarrow, and was at the time unoccupied.
With uncommon industry, although cramped
by the want of money, that would have given
it its full effect, he had reclaimed from a wild
state, about fifty acres of land, which, when we
arrived there, was planted with sugar-cane, corn,
potatoes, bananas, &amp;c., thus providing for his
immediate wants, whilst the cane promised a rich
harvest, that would amply reward him for his toil,
whenever he could complete his machinery for
the manufacture of sugar.  In this, however, to
all appearance when we were there, he would
encounter great difficulty, as materials were not
easily obtained; and although there were some
mechanics on the island, their constant employment
in the village, where they could frequently
see their countrymen, and withal, their fondness
for pleasure was likely to deprive him for a long
time of their useful services, without which, he
could do nothing.  Connected with his land, was
a stream of water running from the mountains,
that would answer his purpose for manufacturing
sugar.  In a part of it that possessed all local
advantages, he had made a dam and collected part of
the materials for a mill, to be constructed in the
simplest manner, but which, for the want of
mechanical aid, lay in almost the same rude state in
which he had purchased them.  He anticipated,
however, with great confidence, that by the time
the cane was ready for cutting, the mill would be
prepared, when the hopes by which he had first
been stimulated, could scarcely fail to be realized.
The sugar cane grows wild upon the Sandwich
Islands, and Mr. Wilkinson's fields were from
the native growth, which he had planted in
prepared land, and at our departure, the canes were
upwards of six feet high.

Although several strangers, familiar with the
arts of civilized countries, have settled and lived,
for many years, amongst the Sandwich Islanders,
Mr. Wilkinson was the first individual who ever
attempted to put them in practice, upon a scale,
sufficiently extensive to improve, materially, the
agricultural condition of the islands, and thereby
prove to the inhabitants the wealth they possess,
in a rich soil, and one of the finest climates on
the face of the globe.  Should Mr. Wilkinson be
successful, the result of his experiment will
probably do more towards the civilization of the
natives, and their ultimate advancement in
knowledge and lasting prosperity, than has yet been
effected by all the white men that have lived
amongst them.  This, I am aware, will be
considered a rash assertion by the good people of our
country, who, from the best of motives, feel deeply
engaged in foreign missions, and, in expressing
this opinion, I will also bear testimony to the
useful services of the missionaries.  From the
best information that I could obtain upon the
subject, I am satisfied, that they have improved the
morals of the people, and if they devote themselves
to the schools that they have established,
and to introducing the arts of life and civilization,
the time may not be distant, when the natives will
be prepared to receive Christianity.  But in their
present condition, would it not be better, and
more in the true spirit of that benevolence and
philanthropy which is inspired by our religion, to
teach them how to cultivate their land, to
introduce grain and fruits, congenial to the climate,
and to plant and reap as we do, rather than imbue
their minds with a mysterious doctrine, which,
being beyond their comprehension, must resolve
itself into a dark and intolerant superstition.
</p>

<p>
The inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands, are
mild, amiable, and intelligent, and susceptible of
the highest degree of moral and intellectual
improvement.  As a people, it may be said, that the
stamp of civilization is scarcely perceptible yet
upon them; and it is now inevitable, that they
must bear the impress of those, whom our
philanthropists have sent to convert them to Christianity;
and, whether they become ignorant zealots, or
intelligent Christians, will depend upon their
teachers.  The situation of these missionaries is,
therefore, one of high responsibility, and ought
not, in Christian charity, to be occupied by the
narrow-minded fanatic, or the ignorant zealot.
It is of the first importance that they, who dispose
of the vast means of the missionary society, should
select only such men for civilizing and Christianizing
the Sandwich Islanders, as are distinguished
for their knowledge, and love of the useful arts
of life, as well as for practical piety.

The harbour of Onavoora, is a place of general
rendezvous for the whale ships, cruising on
the coast of Japan, and in the vicinity of the
islands.  The months of January, February, and
March, being the least favourable for their
business, they then leave their cruising ground, and
go in search of refreshment.  No place is so
convenient for them as the Sandwich Islands, and
the port of Onavoora, being the most commodious
of any in the group, and affording an abundant
supply of vegetables, hogs, &amp;c.,&mdash;they all
congregate there in the months above mentioned.
</p>

<p>
The average number that visit the island in the
course of the year, is upwards of fifty.  More
than twenty were there together, at several
different periods of our stay, some of which
remained a few days, some weeks, and a few one or two
months, according to their several necessities.
At such times the seamen, from having been long
confined to the narrow precinct of their vessels,
become very insubordinate, and frequently give
way to the most licentious indulgences of their
passions, regardless of every obligation of
obedience due to their officers.  We witnessed
frequent instances of this kind, and had the
satisfaction of being constantly useful to the captains of
ships, and the whaling interest, by restraining the
violent, and coercing them to a proper sense of
duty.
</p>

<p>
A most unpleasant occurrence took place about
six weeks after our arrival at Onavoora, arising
from this disposition of the seamen, and other
causes, which was afterwards greatly misrepresented
in this country.  Some of the seamen of
the Dolphin, who were on liberty, got into a
frolic, and, associating themselves with many
others belonging to the whale ships, determined
to go to the houses of the high chiefs and
missionaries, and demand the repeal of a restriction
that deprived them of the society of females.
They produced a riot that gave rise to a
considerable degree of excitement for a few minutes;
but Captain Percival, with some of the officers of
the Dolphin, and captains of whale-ships, promptly
suppressed it, and prevented any serious outrage.
It was afterwards unjustly and most
ungenerously ascribed to the officers of the Dolphin.
</p>

<p>
The white population of Onavoora is of a varied
character, from the agent of our North West
traders, to the most abandoned members of
society.  There are from fifty to a hundred,
permanently settled at Onavoora; the least
respectable of whom, maintain themselves by keeping
tippling shops Tor sailors, and practising such
chicaneries as are suggested by opportunities and
the absence of law.  The season for the whalers
to visit the Island is the time of their harvest,
when, besides their gains from entertaining the
seamen, they frequently prevail upon them to
desert for the sake of the reward for their
apprehension, or to strip them of what little money or
clothes they may be possessed of.  Some of them
have married women of the Island, and live much
in the same way as the natives.  Of all the
permanent settlers at Onavoora, the most remarkable
was a Spaniard by the name of Meninne, who
had been in the Islands upwards of thirty years.
Of his manner of getting there, a variety of
stories were told.  His own account was, that being
invited on board of a vessel that visited the coast
of California, he fell asleep in the evening, and,
when he awoke, found himself at sea, and the
vessel running, with a fair wind, for the Sandwich
Islands.  All his entreaties to be returned
to land were in vain, and he arrived at
Owhyhee, where, poor and friendless, he was
landed amongst the natives.  He wandered from
island to island, in a forlorn and wretched
condition, until he was taken under the patronage of
Tamahamaha.  For a long time, he followed the
fortunes of the native warrior, and at length fixed
his residence at Oahoo, from whence he occasionally
embarked as interpreter on board of merchant
vessels, bound on smuggling voyages to
the coast of America.  After passing through a
variety of fortune, being several times made
prisoner and threatened with death, he finally quitted
his vagrant life, and remained permanently at
Oahoo, where, by great industry and economy,
he has acquired an amount of property which, for
that place, is a princely fortune.  Besides having
money in the United States and England, he owns
nearly all the cattle on the Island of Oahoo, a
number of horses, flocks of goats, sheep, &amp;c.
He has extensive possessions in land, which he
holds from the chiefs in consideration of his
services, and a great many houses.  He has taken
some pains to introduce exotics in the Islands,
and besides the lemon, orange, and other
valuable fruits, has a vineyard from which he makes a
considerable quantity of wine annually.  He is
said to be extremely selfish, and so jealous of
preserving to himself a monopoly of these valuable
fruits, that he has been accused of destroying
the young plants of others.  He is considered as
ranking amongst the chiefs in the enjoyment of
certain privileges; and, speaking the language of
the Islands well, is called upon as interpreter for
the government upon all important occasions.
He has had thirty-seven children by various
wives, and is yet in the prime of life.  Like most
men who have felt the cold hand of poverty, and
afterwards acquired wealth, he is extremely
penurious, and thinks of nothing so much as adding
to his fortune without knowing how to enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
On the 3d of April, the young king and all the
high chiefs, were invited on board to spend the
day with us.  In the morning, we dressed the
schooner in all the flags we could muster, and
made the best preparation our limited accommodation
would admit of to receive our distinguished
guests.  No indication of their appearance was
seen for some time after every thing was in
readiness, and our boats on shore in waiting, and we
were kept in suspense until we had almost
despaired of seeing them.  All at once the whole
town was in an uproar, and the people were running
and hallooing in every direction.  The young
king in advance, walked arm in arm with one of
the officers of the Dolphin.  Next came Boque
and his spouse, with other high dignitaries, and
in the rear a multitude of people of both sexes
and all ages.  When they had embarked, the
eyes of the people were turned upon another
object, not less interesting to them than the king.
Crimacu, or Billy Pitt, too ill to walk, was
gravely making his way to the beach in a hand cart,
where he got into a boat and came on board soon
after the king.  We received them with manned
yards, and a salute of twenty-one guns.  The
king, who was a boy of ten or twelve years old,
was dressed in a military uniform that was sent
to him from the king of England, and upon his
shoulders he wore a pair of golden epaulets, with
crowns on them.  He appeared to be sensible of
his rank, and, upon two or three occasions,
addressed his attendants in a way that indicated a
wish to make a display of his authority.  The
chiefs conducted themselves towards him with a
becoming respect, but without bestowing upon
him any attention that might interfere with their
own enjoyment or convenience.  Instead of
partaking of what we had provided for our guests,
they, with one or two exceptions, unceremoniously
uncovered their poye pots, which had been
brought with them by an attendant, and ate heartily
of their favourite food, using their fingers as is
the native custom.  Boque again displayed his
major general's uniform, and was amongst the
most polished of our guests.  After passing a
number of hours on board, they returned to the
shore delighted with their visit.  The same
compliment was paid them as at their reception.  It
was a day of great enjoyment with the common
people.  They received their chiefs on landing
with loud huzzas, and followed them in crowds to
their respective habitations.
</p>

<p>
We passed all the winter months at Onavoora,
during which we had frequent heavy rains.  Some
of the storms were attended with violent gales,
and disagreeably cold weather.  About the 3d of
May, an influenza made its appearance amongst
the inhabitants of Oahoo, and in two days not a
well native was any where to be seen.  The
market, from being well attended, was deserted.
In a week, the distress was so general and so
great, that it was feared the poor people would
perish with hunger.  I visited several families,
not a member of which was able to help himself
or others, and all were totally destitute of food.
A great many of the people died, and amongst
the rest two chiefs, one of whom was George
Tamauri, a native of the Island of Atooi, who
was educated in this country.  The other was
Cahaliha, next in affinity to the king.  Scarcely
any of the white people were affected.  Not even
those living on shore.  In about ten days, the
people from the country began to make their
appearance in the market, the distress was greatly
alleviated, and soon afterwards the general good
health restored.  At such times of suffering, the
condition of these people is truly wretched.  They
have no floor to their huts but the hard-beaten
ground from which their naked bodies are
separated only by two or three thin mats, and during
the rainy season the earth becomes perfectly
saturated with water.  Their huts are generally built
in a very frail manner, and in a driving storm are
not proof against the rain.  This, alone, is
sufficient to account for the thinly populated state of
the islands, without charging the natives with the
acts of inhumanity that have been ascribed to
them by some people.
</p>

<p>
The harbour of Onavoora is formed by coral
reefs, that extend upwards of a mile from the
shore.  The entrance to it is narrow and
somewhat difficult.  It affords water enough for a
sloop of war.  A pilot in and out of the harbour,
is always employed.  It is very secure, being
quite land locked.  The holding ground is good,
and vessels may lay in safety close along side of
the beach.  The water is perfectly smooth in
good weather, and the bottom and shores being
nearly every where of soft mud, a vessel might
be driven upon them in a gale without sustaining
any material injury.  The visits of the numerous
whale ships has made Onavoora a place of
considerable trade.  All of them spend more or less
money for their necessary refreshments, and when
out of repair, their disbursements are frequently
very considerable.  For the supplies afforded by
the natives, thousands of dollars are annually
received by them, which they give in return for
silk, cotton, calicoes, cloth, &amp;c.  Two or three
stores, well stocked with a great variety of goods,
are supported in Onavoora by this interchange of
commodities; and, from the way in which the
trade is conducted, there is but little doubt that the
proprietors are rewarded with handsome profits.
The sandal wood has become scarce upon the
islands, from the large quantities formerly taken
away by our traders, and does not now form a
very lucrative or extensive article of commerce.
Upon this article, some of our merchants are said
to have made large sums of money in exchange
for whole cargoes of goods, with the chiefs of the
Sandwich Islands.  It is related of Tamahamaha,
that, after making a purchase of this kind, which
he paid for in ship loads of sandal wood, brought
from the mountains with great labour to himself
and people, he has been known to load a number
of canoes secretly at night, with fine broadcloths,
and take them out to sea, where he sunk them
with stones.  His only reason for it was, that the
possession of them would make his chiefs and
people too luxurious and idle, and bringing
sandal wood from the mountains to pay for more,
would give them employment.  A doubtful policy,
certainly, if the statement be true.  Be this
as it may, himself and successor have entailed
upon their descendants a national debt of several
hundred thousands of dollars, now due to our
merchants, which they will not soon be able to
liquidate.
</p>

<p>
On the 11th of May, after long anticipating our
much wished for departure, we got underway,
and saluting the fort as we passed it with twenty-one
guns, stood out to sea and shaped our course
for Chili.  Nothing material transpired from the
time of our sailing until the 7th of June, when
standing along with a fresh trade, and the night
dark and squally, at 10 P.M., the lookout-ahead
reported land close aboard.  We tacked and lay
to for the night, to survey our newly discovered
island on the following morning.  At daylight, it
bore S.S.W., about six miles from us, and
appeared in three small hummocs, covered thickly
with trees and bushes, every where bounded by a
coral reef and heavy surf.  We hesitated for
some time whether we should land, apprehending
that it would be attended with too much risk,
merely for the gratification of curiosity; but this
feeling operated so powerfully upon us, that there
was no resisting the desire to land where no one
had ever been before.  Accordingly, two boats
were sent off, and watching a favourable
opportunity passed through the surf in safety, and
landed on the coral bank where they were left
high and dry by the receding wave.  It was on
the lee side of the island, and a coral reef
stretched off about fifty or a hundred yards from the
shore, full of holes, and almost dry at low water.
In the holes we sought for fish, as at Caroline
Island, but found very few.  On traversing the
island, we could find no fruit or vegetable of any
description except bup.  In most places it was
covered with trees and bushes of a thick growth,
almost impenetrable.  In the bushes we found a
great many tropical birds setting, so tame that
we could take them off of their nests with our
hands, and in getting upon the weather side of
the island where there was a clear space, we
found a species of small gull, so numerous, that
when they rose from the ground at our approach,
they appeared to form almost a compact mass.
The sand was literally covered with their eggs,
which, upon examination, proved to be unfit for
use, with few exceptions.  The birds flew and
hovered so near to us that we caught several of
them with our hands.  After amusing ourselves
a little while with the novel spectacle of such
numbers of birds so very tame, we collected all
the old eggs within a small space, and in less
than twenty minutes after it had been thus
cleared, it was again covered with fresh eggs by the
birds that were constantly lighting.  We might,
in a few hours, have loaded our boats with them.
When we returned to our boats to go on board,
the tide had risen, and with it the surf had
increased to an alarming degree.  At first, we held
a consultation whether we should attempt to pass
through it or remain until it should again subside
with the falling of the tide; but the day was far
advanced, and the appearance of the weather
such, as in all probability would render our
situation extremely painful, there being every
prospect of an increase of wind.  We therefore
determined to put our fortune to the test, and were
not a little discouraged when on one of the boats
attempting the surf was thrown back by the second
roller that she encountered with the utmost
violence, upsetting her, and scattering the people
in different directions, some of them escaping with
their lives with the greatest difficulty.
Notwithstanding the ill success of our first attempt, we
determined on a second, rather than risk the
consequences of longer delay.  Embracing a favourable
opportunity where the surf appeared least violent,
we put off, and passed through it in safety
without further accident.
</p>

<p>
The island was little more than a mile long,
and from a hundred yards to a quarter of a mile
wide.  It was every where very low.  By a
meridian observation, we placed the north-west end
of it in latitude south 21 degrees 48 minutes, and
longitude by chronometer 154 degrees 54 minutes
west.  In compliment to the commander of
our squadron in the Pacific Ocean, we called it
Hull's Island.  It may be comprehended within
the group of Society Islands.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon, June the 4th, we made sail;
and on the following day at half-past 6 o'clock,
A.M. discovered the island of Ramitaria, on the lee bow,
about eight leagues from us.  This island was
not laid down in any of our charts, having been
discovered only three or four years before; but
we had seen a gentlemen who had stopped there,
and it was included in our list of islands.  On
approaching it we were pleased to find that it
differed from many of the islands we had visited, being
of a moderate elevation.  It is about three miles
long and one or two wide.  We ran nearly
round it before we found a place to land, the surf
breaking high every where, and the shores bounded
by large rocks of coral.  At last, we came to
the principal settlement, which was situated close
to the shore, where a large white-washed house
indicated the former visits and influences of the
missionaries.  The people, to the number of one
or two hundred, were assembled on the beach
inviting us to land.  Here, also, was a considerable
surf and some coral rocks, which made the
landing not altogether free from difficulty.  When
the boat came near the shore and while she was
yet shooting rapidly through the surf, the natives,
who had already advanced to meet us, laid hold
as many as could get round her, and with loud
shouting, carried us high upon the beach.  At
this somewhat unexpected reception, the boat's
crew instinctively seized their pistols, thinking at
first, that the natives were hostile in their
disposition towards us.  It was but a momentery panic
which passed away with the kind salutations we
immediately afterwards received.  When I
enquired for the chief, a young man was pointed out
to me in the crowd, distinguished from the rest
by an old hat on his head, that he had obtained
from some former visiter.  He seemed not to be
treated with the least respect by the people, who
jostled him in the crowd with the most perfect
carelessness.  Scarcely had I addressed him,
when a stout native came up with an air of some
importance, and saluting me, told me in the
language of the Society Islands, that he was the
missionary.  Upon his approach, the chief
immediately shrunk back into the crowd.  He called
to him a Malay, who was not far off, and bade
him ask what we wanted.  The Malay, whose
name was Manoo, spoke English very well, which
was a source of great satisfaction to us, as we
could thereby communicate our wants freely, and
it introduced us at once to each others'
acquaintance.  I explained to Manoo that we were in
want of water and such refreshments as the island
might afford.  He immediately proceeded in
company with the missionary to show me where
water was to be obtained.  We passed through a
forest of very large trees over a plain that
extended more than half a mile, when we came to a
marsh of reeds and rank grass, where there was
from one to two feet of water, covering an area
of two or three acres.  This would not answer
our purpose as the water was not very good, and
its distance from the place of embarkation
rendered it too laborious an undertaking to water the
vessel from it.  When I had remarked this to
Manoo and the missionary, they replied that there
was better water, but it was still more distant.
I suffered them to conduct me to it, and we took
a footpath over rising ground, and through
another delightful forest of bread-fruit and other
wide-spreading trees, passing many fine tarrow
patches, and at the distance of half a mile from
the marsh, we came to a spring of excellent
water.  Manoo and the missionary both expressed
a great deal of disappointment when I spoke in
terms of disapprobation of this also as a
watering-place&mdash;it being altogether too far from the shore.
On our return from the spring, we took a different
footpath from that by which we came, and
ascended to a more elevated part of the island to
see the work of the missionary, as it was called
by Manoo.  This consisted of two or three
enclosures by means of stakes, in the midst of the
forest, where the trees had been cut down for
several acres, which was cleared and planted
with sweet potatoes and tobacco.  The enclosures
were made, and all the labour of clearing the
forest was done, as Manoo remarked, by such of
the wicked and disobedient, as had resisted the
authority and ordinances of the white missionary
during his residence on the island some months
previous.  Since then, the white missionary had
returned to Otaheite, and sent this native
missionary, who belonged to that island, to represent
him in his absence.  Leaving the enclosures of
tobacco and sweet potatoes, we came into a thicket
where the trees were overrun with the vines of
the yam, growing wild and covered with beautiful
blue flowers that gave a picturesque appearance
to the forest, and filled it with their
fragrance.  We passed five or six stone columns
that had been sixty or seventy feet high, and
twenty or thirty in circumference.  They were
in a dilapidated state, having in part been thrown
down by order of the missionaries.  Manoo told
me that they were monuments erected in honour
of the Indian god.  Several of these ruins were
standing by the side of an old burial-place in the
edge of the woods near the shore.  Each of the
graves were neatly enclosed with a wall of stone.
When we returned to the village, I was taken to
a large frame building called the missionary house,
where the missionary had prepared a roasted pig
and some tarrow, for our dinner.  He designed to
entertain me after the manner of the whites, and
with this view, had placed our repast on a large
coarse table that stood in the middle of the room
with benches round it.  When we were seated,
he unlocked a chest and took from it a plate
for each of us, and a knife and fork, all of which
were extremely dirty, and the knives and forks
quite covered with rust.  This, however, he did
not seem to remark, although he evidently
wished me to think that he knew how to be polite,
after the fashion of my country people.  He
acquitted himself pretty well, to his own satisfaction,
until he attempted to use the knife and fork&mdash;but
that was altogether too much for him.  After
making several trials in vain to cut his meat,
he asked me to assist him; and finally, before he
had half finished his dinner, laid down his clumsy
instruments and used his fingers.  The chief, and
as many of the natives as could get into the room
came round us, but none of them were invited to
partake with the missionary and myself, except
Manoo, whilst the hungry crowd stood looking
wistfully at us.
</p>

<p>
Soon after we had finished our dinner, the
captain and several of the officers landed, and we
exchanged several articles with the natives for
their pigs, yams, &amp;c.  The following day was
their Sabbath and our Saturday, and they insisted
that we should remain until Monday, before any
exchange of commodities took place.  When,
however, we declared our determination to depart
that evening, they began collecting whatever
might be acceptable to us.  Hogs of various
sizes, were brought to the beach in great numbers.
Needles, jack-knives, and old clothes, were
our articles of traffic, than which we could have
offered them nothing more valuable.  By sundown,
we had collected from thirty to forty hogs,
and a good supply of yams.  In a few hours
more, we might have obtained twice as many
upon the same terms.
</p>

<p>
Towards the close of the day, when the missionary
felt assured that it was our determination
to depart, he asked if I was a doctor, or had any
skill in medicine; and, although I replied in the
negative, insisted upon my going to his house to
see, and prescribe for his wife, who, he told me,
was extremely ill.  Upon entering his hut, we
found her laying on a mat on the floor; and
notwithstanding the weather was oppressively warm,
she was covered over with a great many pieces
of the tappa cloth, head and all, and perspiring
most profusely.  The missionary, with great
gravity, but most unceremoniously, removed all
the covering, and pointed out to me her infirmity,
which was nothing more than a common bile,
with which she seemed to be suffering considerable
pain.  I declined prescribing, although
repeatedly requested to do so; and at sun-down,
we embarked and made sail.  Had it been
convenient for us to remain two days longer at
Ramitarias, we could have obtained an abundant
supply of whatever the island produced, for a very
trifling consideration; but although there was
anchorage, it was unsheltered, and too near the shore
for us to ride in safety.
</p>

<p>
At six, P.M. on the 10th of June, we took our
departure from Ramitarias; and at day-light, on
the 13th, made the Island of Toubouai, bearing to
the northward and eastward, about eight leagues
from us.  In getting in with the S.W. part of the
island, we found an extensive reef, upon which
the surf was breaking with great violence.  We
hauled round to the east side, passing two small
uninhabited islands, but there was not the slightest
appearance of a landing-place, the surf breaking
heavily as far as we could see.  At four, P.M. we
anchored on the north side, in seven fathoms
water, and sent boats in search of the harbour,
along the west shore.  In the evening, they
returned, having found it, and on the following
morning, we got underway, and beat up for it.
When we had advanced near the opening, through
the coral reefs that extend from the shore several
miles, a Mr. Strong, an American, came on board,
and piloted us in through a difficult passage.  The
channel was narrow, and very crooked; but we
had not less than three and a half fathoms water.
Our anchorage was within a coral reef, about a
mile from the shore, in four and a half fathoms.
On the day previous to entering the harbour, we
discovered that the head of our mainmast was
decayed, and badly sprung.  In this situation, we
congratulated ourselves in having found a secure
harbour, where the water was tolerably smooth,
which was very essential in fixing the mast securely.
</p>

<p>
Nearly all the inhabitants of Toubouai,
consisting of about two hundred, were living on the
side of the island where we were anchored, in
two different settlements.  One of them was the
residence of two Otaheite missionaries, who
governed in spiritual and temporal affairs; and at
the other, was the residence of the king, who,
since the coming of the missionaries, retained but
a small share of the power that formerly
appertained to his station.  He lived on apparently good
terms with the missionaries, fearing their influence
with the people, but secretly declaring his
aversion to them.  He was the more afraid of
offending them, as there was a living example of
their displeasure constantly before him, in the
person of one who had formerly exercised the
regal authority in the missionary village, of which
they had divested him for disobedience, and
compelled him to live in the condition of a common
private person.  Soon after the arrival of the
missionaries, the people became divided into two
parties, one of which advocated matrimony, and
the other the unrestrained indulgence which is
practised in a state of nature.  The first, called
themselves the missionary party; the latter, the
party of the Tutiori.  After a long struggle for
the ascendency, the Tutiories took up arms and
retired from the habitable part of the island,
declaring themselves independent of the missionaries.
They remained for several days undisturbed
in their disobedience, when a party was
sent to bring them to terms.  The Tutiories at
first retreated, but finally made a stand, and after
a slight show of resistance, submitted, promising
to go home and live in the observance of the
missionary precepts.  The dethroned king, was at
the head of the Tutiories.
</p>

<p>
At the lower village, as it was called by us,
where the king lived, was a party of our countrymen,
who had been there for a number of months
building a vessel.  They had completed the frame
and commenced planking, when, unfortunately, a
quarrel arose between them and the people of the
missionary village, which terminated in open
hostility, and the loss of several lives.  One of the
white men only, was killed.  Scarcely had they
made peace with the natives, when they quarrelled
among themselves, and nearly half of their
number (four or five) discontinued their work,
and waited only for an opportunity to leave the
island.  This mutinous disposition of a few,
paralized the efforts of the whole party, and it was
probable from appearances, that the labour they
had bestowed with so much effect, would be
entirely lost to themselves and their employer,
Captain Dana of Massachusetts, whom we had
seen at Oahoo.
</p>

<p>
The king and myself, became high carnies, (or
great friends) the day after our arrival; and
from that time until our departure, he did
everything in his power to merit my regard.  My mess
was constantly supplied with bread-fruit,
cocoa-nuts, tarrow, and bananas; and whenever I was
on shore, he waited upon me everywhere with
the most friendly attention.  Our friendship
commenced in the following manner, simple enough,
it is true, but I believe it was not the less sincere
on that account.  Seeing me with a jack-knife in
my hand, he expressed a wish to look at it, when
I told him that he might have it.  He received it,
and after observing me for a moment, put his
hand upon my arm and remarked, now you and
I will be high carnies.  I sincerely reciprocated
his kindness, so strongly recommended by the
disinterested simplicity with which it was proffered.
Two or three days after our arrival, I landed
with a view of traversing the island.  I found
king Dick, as I used to call him, upon a bank of
coral that stretched out from his house, with a
long wooden spear in his hand, looking about in
the holes for fish.  He begged me to wait until
he had taken one for his dinner, and he would
accompany me.  Accordingly, having succeeded in
a few minutes afterwards, we set off together.
</p>

<p>
The island was two or three miles wide, and
we had not proceeded far, when we came to an
extensive marsh that runs through the middle of
it.  King Dick stopped, and insisted upon carrying
me over on his back.  Feeling that it was
too menial an office to be performed by a king,
although an untutored native, I remonstrated
with him, and positively refused to be carried;
but after resisting his importunity for some time,
he took my musket in his hand, and I mounted on
his shoulders.  The marsh was several hundred
yards wide, and king Dick found his burthen very
heavy before he landed me on the opposite side.
We there entered upon a romantic and extensive
plain, covered with cocoa-nut, and bread-fruit
trees, plantain walks, papayas, &amp;c.; interspersed
through which, were numerous huts that
appeared to have been long deserted.  We traversed
this plain for miles, with little variation; the
same pleasing prospect everywhere presenting
itself, when suddenly king Dick stopped, and
made the whole forest ring with the shrill notes
of his voice.  After repeating it for several times,
he was answered at a distance, and soon
afterwards, we saw a native making his approaches
towards us.  King Dick said something to him,
and he ascended a cocoa-nut tree, after the
manner of the people of the Marquesas, and threw
down a sufficient quantity of nuts to quench our
thirst.  He afterwards conducted us to a house
where there were two women and several children.
They were delighted to see us, and hospitably
proffered whatever they had of refreshment.
They gave us a preparation of dried
bread-fruit, of which king Dick ate very heartily,
but to me it was scarcely palatable.  Near the
house there were several citron and lemon trees,
the only ones that I saw on the island.
</p>

<p>
In our route back, we met with large quantities
of sugar cane in a wild state.  We passed the
burial-place of the village, where, beside two or
three newly made graves, were rudely carved
images placed there in conformity to a native
custom, that had not yet been abolished by the
influence of the missionaries.  When we arrived
at king Dick's house, we found dinner waiting for
us.  It consisted of the fish he had taken in
the morning before our departure, roasted fowls,
bread-fruit, tarrow, &amp;c.  The whole was wrapped
up in plantain leaves, and placed on a mat
upon the floor, around which, we all seated
ourselves, there being a number of visiters
present.  During our repast, king Dick went
frequently to a large chest, where he kept a bottle
of rum I had given him, and, after proffering me
the bottle, he would help himself, and lock it up
in the chest again, without taking the least notice
of the rest of his visiters.  No miser ever
guarded his treasure more penuriously than the king
did his bottle of rum; not only on this, but all
other occasions.  His house was large, and a
lounging place for all the idle people of his
village; and, although there were always a number
present when I made my visits, and he never
failed to offer me a portion of his favourite
beverage, the wistful lookers-on received not the
slightest notice.  I once ventured to propose to him to
give some to his friends, but he said no, it was
too good for them.  When, after a week's stay at
Toubouai, our departure was spoken of, king
Dick expressed the liveliest regret, and proposed
going with us.  We told him that he would never
be able to get back again; to which he replied,
that he should not care about returning.  The
day before we left, he sent me, on board, an
abundant sea-stock, of fruits and vegetables, and
a good-sized hog.  As a parting gift, I dressed
him up in an old uniform of mine, that seemed to
give him infinite pleasure.  To his presents, his
wife added several pieces of the tappa cloth, some
of which, were as fine specimens of the native
manufacture, as I ever met with anywhere.
</p>

<p>
At Toubouai, we added considerably to our
collection of curiosities.  The most ingeniously
wrought article, was a lash, used by the natives
for brushing the flies off of their backs.  The
handles were carved to represent a man's face,
or some animal familiar to them.  The lash
itself, was, in several strands, finely braided from
twine of the cocoa-nut husk.  The natives were,
in general, naked, except a wrapper round their
waists, and had a sickly and feeble look.  The
island is very fertile, producing, in many parts,
large quantities of cocoa-nut and bread-fruit, and
is capable, without further improvement, of
sustaining some thousands of people.  The population
has greatly diminished within the recollection
of recent visiters.  It must have been much
greater when visited by the mutineers of the Bounty,
who built a fort on the island, but afterwards
became dissatisfied, and left it in consequence of the
treacherous and hostile character of the natives.
The only survivor of those guilty men, who is
now the patriarch of Pitcairn's Island, states,
that they had war with the natives previous to
leaving Toubouai, and that they killed a great
many of them.  His estimate of the inhabitants
at that time, is fifteen thousand.  King Dick told
me, that the huts we saw on the side of the island
opposite to where we anchored, were once
inhabited by people who were all dead.  We
obtained wood and water of a good quality, without
much labour.  Hogs were scarce, and we got
none but what were presented to us.  The natives
gave us a few domestic fowls, in exchange for
writing paper.  The paper was used by the
women for making paste-board for a bonnet, that
had just been introduced amongst them by the
wives of the Otaheite missionaries.
</p>

<p>
On the island of Toubouai, there is a tree, the
bark of which, makes excellent cordage.  It is
produced in great abundance, and grows to the
size of six or eight inches in diameter.  After
the ship builders were interrupted in their work,
by the discontent of some of the party, the
remainder made a rope-walk, and devoted
themselves to making rope of this bark.  They
had several small cables, and a considerable
quantity of rope.  We purchased some, and found
it to wear nearly, or quite, as well as hemp.
Arrow root, grows spontaneously upon the island,
and has been taken away by several vessels, as
an article of commerce.  We were informed that
the scarcity of hogs was in consequence of a
great many having been carried off recently, by
a vessel belonging to the missionaries.  Also,
that they lay all the small islands under contribution,
and annually send their small vessels to
collect the hogs, which they barrel, and send to
Port Jackson.  This may be true or not.  It was
positively asserted.
</p>

<p>
Our stock of bread was nearly exhausted, and
what remained, was in a damaged state.  Having
failed in all our attempts to obtain a supply of
yams, that would enable us to reach the coast of
South America, an examination was held upon
the bread, to the end, that we might adopt such
expedients as should be deemed most proper.
Valparaiso, was our most direct port; there was
but one inhabited island (Oparro,) in our way,
and that at some distance from a straight course.
To avoid, however, so disagreeable a circumstance
as being without bread, we determined to
touch at Oparro, and get whatever we could for
a substitute.  Accordingly, we put to sea on the
22d of June, and on the 25th, made Oparro, a
little before day-light, five leagues from us.
When we came near, its appearance was rude
and inhospitable in the extreme, being a mass of
rugged mountains, about a thousand feet high,
and eight or ten miles in circumference.  On the
north-west side, there were no signs of inhabitants.
The mountains rose almost perpendicularly from
the Ocean, and we sounded frequently, close to
the shore, without getting bottom.  In rounding
the island, to the northward and eastward, we
opened a valley, where there was a number of
huts, and some patches of tarrow.  A boat was
sent in shore, and two of the natives came on
board, who informed us that there was a harbour
to the eastward.  We continued on, and after
landing at one or two other small valleys, where there
were huts and tarrow patches, opened a beautiful
deep bay, that had an appearance of great
fertility.  Soon afterwards, an Englishman came on
board, and offered to pilot us in.  He had not
advanced far with the vessel, before she grounded
on a bank of coral, but fell off immediately, on
putting the helm down and throwing all aback.
We were everywhere surrounded by shoals of
coral, and fearful of accidents, came to outside of
the harbour, where we had ten fathoms of water
on one side, and five on the other.  The boats
were sent off immediately, in search of tarrow.
It was planted everywhere, in large patches,
where there was a small valley, through which
a stream of water found its way from the mountains
to the sea, and at a distance, the hills were
green with another species we had not before
seen, called mountain tarrow.  The latter is
superior to the low land tarrow, and will keep
longer at sea.
</p>

<p>
When we landed in the bay, which was several
miles deep, we found two different missionary
establishments, occupied by natives of Otaheite.
No one else, that we saw, seemed to have
any authority.  They permitted us to dig as
much tarrow as we pleased, without asking any
return for it, and by night, we had as much on
board as we knew what to do with.  One of the
missionary establishments was situated at the
extreme depth of the bay.  On landing there, I was
met by the missionaries themselves, and conducted
to their house, where their wives, who were
also from Otaheite, received me, dressed in their
own island costume, with large straw bonnets on
their heads.  After remaining with them for a
few minutes, I repaired to the place where the
boats' crew were employed in collecting tarrow.
A group of natives, male and female, had assembled
round, none of whom, could be prevailed upon
by the rewards we offered them, to assist our
people in their occupation.  They had a sickly look,
almost without an exception.  Their dress differed
altogether from any we had before seen.  It
consisted of a heavy mat of grass, weighing from
ten to fifteen pounds, which was thrown over
their shoulders, and another light mat of the same
material, for the loins.  Their deportment was
modest and retiring, and they evinced a disposition
to have but little intercourse with us.  A
few of their houses were scattered about upon the
hills.  They were extremely miserable, and might,
without disparagement, be compared to dog
kennels.  They were long, and very narrow, and
about three or four feet high, so that when one
entered them, it was necessary to get down upon
the hands and knees.  The Otaheite missionaries
were distinguished from the natives, by wearing
the tappa cloth, of their own island, and an old
cloth jacket they had obtained from white visiters.
I added something to their stock of clothes, before
I took leave of them, for which, they gave
me many thanks.  When I returned on board, I
found the other two missionaries there, and
several of the natives, who had accompanied the
captain.  They spent the night with us, and the next
morning, showed us where to obtain a quantity
of the mountain tarrow.  It is large, and very
much resembles the West India yam.  For a
vessel long at sea, and requiring vegetables, there
is none more valuable.
</p>

<p>
The Englishman who came on board to act as
our pilot, was residing at the island, in charge of
a party which had been left there by the English
Consul at the Sandwich Islands, to collect beach
la mer, a valuable article of commerce, at Canton.
The collecting of sandal-wood, was also to be an
object of their attention; but they told us, that
both were scarce, and difficult to obtain&mdash;a
statement, we considered, of doubtful veracity.
</p>

<p>
At 2, P.M., on the 27th of June, we got underway,
and made sail for Valparaiso, which is distant
from Oparro, about three thousand five hundred
miles.  This island, which is called by the
discoverer, Oparro, is called by the natives, Lapa.
It is situated in latitude 27 degrees 34 minutes
south, west longitude 144 degrees.  At 5, P.M.,
we saw the islands, called by Quiros, Los
Corones, and hauled up, until eight, to clear them.
</p>

<p>
For the first three days after we sailed, it blew
a severe gale from the westward, after which, it
became more moderate, but nearly all our
passage to Valparaiso, was wet and boisterous.  It
was less disagreeable, however, than we anticipated,
as the wind was almost constantly fair.
We had the more reason to apprehend a severe
trial of our fortitude, as it was in the dead of
winter that we were advancing into a high latitude,
after having been a long time within the tropics,
and besides that, our sails and rigging were very
much worn, some of our articles of provisions
were quite exhausted, and others, of the first
necessity, reduced to a small quantity.  If,
therefore, we had encountered tedious gales ahead, we
must have suffered greatly in our shattered and
ill-fitted condition.
</p>

<p>
At 4, P.M., on the 19th of July, we made the
island of Mas a Fuera, on the coast of Chili,
seventy miles from us, and at midnight, passed
close to it.  At day-light, Juan Fernandes, was
in sight, fifty miles off.  We passed it a little
after meridian.  It is very mountainous, but well
covered with trees.  The interesting fable of
Robinson Crusoe's adventures, has given it a lasting
fame, and rendered it an object of curiosity to
all who visit this part of the Pacific Ocean.  It is
very fertile, and has been tolerably well
cultivated.  The Spanish captain-general of Chili,
formerly made it a place of banishment, and after
the revolution took place in that country, it was
appropriated to the same purpose, by the patriots
and royalists, as they alternately came into
power.  A considerable town was built by the exiles,
who were sent there at different times, and the finest
fruits of Chili are produced in great abundance.
The cattle that have been left upon the island,
are running wild in large herds, and several
persons have found it profitable to send parties
there to kill them for their hides.  The island
produces some sandal-wood, but it is small, and
has never been collected in large quantities.
</p>

<p>
Fish, that very much resemble our codfish, and a
variety of other kinds are taken in the greatest
abundance around Juan Fernandez and Mas a
Fuera.  It is believed that if a fishery were
established there by some of our enterprising
countrymen, it would be found a source of great
emolument.  The privileges that might be considered
necessary for the prosperity of a company formed
with this object, could easily be obtained from
the government of Chili, and there is no apparent
cause why the most successful results should not
be realized.  It seems only necessary to call the
attention of our capitalists to this subject, to have
all its advantages secured to our country.  It has
a fine harbour for the prevailing winds of summer,
but in the winter season, when the winds set in
from the northward, it is exposed.  It lies a little
more than three hundred miles from the coast of
Chili, and in the summer months I have known
open boats to pass between it and Valparaiso.
</p>

<p>
On the 23d of July, we anchored in the harbour
of Valparaiso, a little before day-light, to
the gratification of our friends, who were becoming
very much alarmed for our safety, no information
of us having been received during the
whole period of our absence.  Thus, in a vessel
of 180 tons burthen, poorly fitted, and having on
board only about four months' provisions, when
we sailed from the coast of Peru, we performed a
cruise of upwards of eleven months in an unfrequented
Ocean, rendering to our countrymen, and
many of the people whom we visited, important
benefits, besides realizing the most successful
results in the primary object of our cruise.  Its
beneficial effects will long be felt by our countrymen,
who are engaged in the whale-fishery; and,
although we suffered many hardships, privations,
and dangers, we were happy in being the instruments,
in the hands of Providence and our government,
of proving that crime cannot go unpunished
in the remotest part of the earth, and that no
situation is so perilous as to justify despair.
